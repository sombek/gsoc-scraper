If you are a student interested in our [projects](https://ml4sci.org/activities/gsoc2025.html) please check our [ideas page](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2025/summary.html). ML4Sci is an umbrella organization that welcomes other projects and organizations related to machine-learning for science. Please contact the admins at [ml4-sci@cern.ch](mailto:ml4-sci@cern.ch) if you are interested in participating as a project. Our contributors publish [scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals](https://ml4sci.org/activities/papers.html).\n\n![Image 2: GSoC-logo](https://ml4sci.org/images/GSoC/GSoC-icon-192.png)\n\nPlease take a look at our [GSoC Page](https://ml4sci.org/activities/gsoc2025.html) for more details.\n\nIf you are interested in AI in Humanities and Arts please visit our sister GSoC Organization [HumanAI](https://humanai.foundation/) planning to take part in GSoC 2025.\n\nIf you are interested in our activities please join our [announcements mailing list](https://simba3.web.cern.ch/simba3/SelfSubscription.aspx?groupName=ml4sci-announce). To join, you will need to create a [CERN lightweight account](https://account.cern.ch/account/externals/).\n\nYou can also find us on [Gitter](https://matrix.to/#/#ML4SCI_general:gitter.im).\n\n**Latest update: evaluation test release date: 02/27.**\n\nOrganization administrators:  \n[Prof. Sergei Gleyzer (University of Alabama)](http://sergeigleyzer.com/)  \n[Prof. Emanuele Usai (University of Alabama)](https://emanueleusai.com/)  \n[Dr. Patrick Peplowski (JHUAPL)](https://civspace.jhuapl.edu/people/patrick-peplowski)\n"}
