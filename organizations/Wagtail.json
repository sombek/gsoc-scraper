With one final push, we can get fundamental features all compatible with CSPs, document support, and treat any gaps as bugs.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n*   [CSP compatibility issues #1288](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/1288)\n*   [A list of widgets breaking strict Content-Security-Policy (CSP) directives #7053](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/7053)\n*   [Wagtail Stimulus Adoption Schedule (2022-25) üéõÔ∏è](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LdrXlj8OeCWy3B_moYZ-ynhfZZtFVHPahG9GFoT-XBs/edit).\n\n### Expected outcomes\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#expected-outcomes)\n\n*   Addressing any remaining CSP issues in Wagtail.\n*   Providing official recommendations for compatible CSP settings.\n*   Ensuring essential functionality works with a strict CSP.\n*   Documenting or backlogging all CSP-related issues.\n*   Adding a strict CSP to wagtail.org.\n\n### Implementation\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#implementation)\n\nThis will require reviewing existing issues and technical discovery work to device a plan for addressing them. Understanding options in [django-csp](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp), and possibly trialing any changes with [core Django CSP support](https://github.com/django/django/pull/18215).\n\nThe changes required will be a mix of front-end and backend work, and require expertise with security fundamentals to understand what is needed.\n\n### Skills\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#skills)\n\n*   Django\n*   JavaScript\n*   Security headers\n*   CSP\n*   Cross-site scripting\n*   Technical writing\n\n### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#mentors)\n\n*   Lead: TBC - Sage Abdullah\n*   Support: TBC\n*   Support: TBC\n\n### Size\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#size)\n\nExpected size of project approximately 350 hours.\n\n### Difficulty rating\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#difficulty-rating)\n\nHigh\n\nGrid-aware websites\n-------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#grid-aware-websites)\n\n### Summary\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#summary-1)\n\nWe want to trial the [grid-aware websites](https://wagtail.org/blog/reflections-on-grid-aware-websites/) concept on a real Wagtail project: the [wagtail.org website](https://wagtail.org/). This will involve understanding what grid awareness means for websites, how to implement it with Wagtail, and how to measure the website‚Äôs energy use depending on different adaptations.\n\n### Expected outcomes\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#expected-outcomes-1)\n\n*   A grid-aware version of the wagtail.org website.\n*   A blog post explaining the process and outcomes.\n*   A report on energy use of different website front-end and back-end components.\n*   A set of recommendations for other Wagtail websites to become grid-aware.\n\n### Implementation\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#implementation-1)\n\nThis is highly dependent on the outcome of the ongoing grid-aware websites project, which is currently under way. More information will be available in March 2025.\n\n### Skills\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#skills-1)\n\n*   JavaScript\n*   Django\n*   Cloudflare workers\n*   Digital sustainability\n*   Performance auditing\n\n### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#mentors-1)\n\n*   Lead: Thibaud Colas\n*   Support: TBC\n*   Support: TBC\n\n### Size\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#size-1)\n\nExpected size of project approximately 350 hours.\n\n### Difficulty rating\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#difficulty-rating-1)\n\nHigh\n\nProject proposal: your own idea\n-------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#project-proposal-your-own-idea)\n\nYou can also propose your own idea. Your proposal should:\n\n*   Have a concrete task.\n*   Give a solid idea of what will constitute success. You tell us.\n*   Present a detailed design specification.\n*   Give insight into who you are. If you propose something ambitious, convince us that you are up to the task.\n*   Give insight into your previous projects and experience.\n*   Tell us about your experience with Python/Django/Wagtail.\n*   Provide a schedule, including a detailed work breakdown and major milestones.\n*   Contain your motivation and curriculum vitae.\n\nHere is an example of [an accepted proposal](https://gist.github.com/chrismedrela/82cbda8d2a78a280a129) on Django.\n\nNote:\n\n*   The project ideas above are starting points for your submission, but aren‚Äôt enough by themselves. You‚Äôll need to come up with a more complete project plan, and use your own words.\n*   Do not feel limited to the project ideas below.\n*   If you have a project idea not listed, please direct message the [organisation admins](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#organisation-admins). They can test the project eligibility and pair you with a mentor for initial feedback.\n\nProject proposals should fall into one of three categories:\n\n*   Work on Wagtail itself. The core product.\n*   Work on tools to support Wagtail. Example: Editor guide as a Wagtail website.\n*   Wagtail third-party libraries. Example: [Wagtail Live](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live) is a GSOC 2021 project.\n\nThe project you propose should be:\n\n*   Something useful for the Wagtail project\n*   A single well-scoped project\n*   Achievable within the time of GSoC\n*   And something the core developers can help mentor you on.\n\nTemplate: project idea title\n----------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#template-project-idea-title)\n\n### Summary\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#summary-2)\n\n### Expected outcomes\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#expected-outcomes-2)\n\n### Implementation\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#implementation-2)\n\n### Skills\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#skills-2)\n\n### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#mentors-2)\n\n*   Lead: TBC\n*   Support: TBC\n\n### Size\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#size-2)\n\nExpected size of project approximately 350 hours.\n\n### Difficulty rating\n\n[](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md#difficulty-rating-2)\n\nLow / Medium / High\n"}
