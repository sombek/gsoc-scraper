Furthermore, they are also required in many demo and training situations.\n\nThis project is a Setup Agent App that automates all of the above based on either a series of slash commands or by loading an automated script.\n\nThe script should conform to an easy to learn, intuitive and simple DSL (Domain Specific Langauge) of the contributor's design.\n\nThe language needs to incorporate basic variables, and be able to handle simple counted loops. Conditionals and conditional loops are nice to have.\n\nThe agent should be tested to handle very large scripts that may involve the creation of thousands of objects and messages.\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Interest in DSL and AST (Domain Specific Language and Abstract Syntax Trees)\n*   Rocket.Chat Apps development (Typescript)\n*   Familiarity with Rocket.Chat's REST APIs\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\nA Rocket.Chat App \"agent\" that can help setup servers (or for QA or demo or training) by executing an automated script.\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 90 hours (Small)\n\n📈 Difficulty: Easy/Intermediate\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 AI Enhanced Message Composer Component\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#-ai-enhanced-message-composer-component)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Gabriel Engel, Ashutosh Singh Chauhan\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nThis high impact project upgrades the Rocket.Chat message composer component to be fully _AI powered_. It empowers Rocket.Chat users to leverage all that modern AI technologies can offer while they are composing their message. These facilities, in 2025, may include:\n\n*   grammar corrections\n*   context sensitive spelling correction\n*   re-wording/re-phrasing for clarity / jargon-match\n*   tone Adjustments\n*   tone matching with messages in channel\n*   language translation\n*   message emojification\n*   message summarization and/or message verbose-tization\n*   and many more to come in 2025/2026\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Inline Suggestions: Highlight areas needing improvement (grammar, clarity). Click to apply changes.\n*   Tone Selector: Add a dropdown to adjust the tone (e.g., formal or casual), and apply the change automatically.\n*   Message Preview: Allow users to toggle between the original and enhanced/translate message.\n*   Hinting: Display suggestions as subtle highlights or underlines, ensuring a smooth, non-intrusive experience.\n\n**AI Integration Consideration**\n\n*   This project / upgraded component will not include the LLM access mechanism. It is a pure UI component project. However, care must be taken to design it in such a way that it can be totally compatible with all kinds of LLM access -- client-side, server-side on-premises, server-side third party, cloud, and so on.\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Advanced understanding of Rocket.Chat Composer Component\n*   Advanced understanding of UI/Kit and Fuselage design philosophy\n*   Advanced JavaScript/TypeScript\\*\\*\n*   Like coding, love design\n*   Love to work in maximum impact projects\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\n*   **AI Enhancements** in the Message Composer.\n*   **UI/UX Polish** for a seamless experience.\n*   **Cross-Platform Support** across web, mobile, and electron clients.\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 175 hours (Medium)  \n📈 **Difficulty:** Advanced\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Project Management Integration via Asana\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#-project-management-integration-via-asana)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Gustavo Bauer\n\n💬 **Description:**  \nIntegrate [Asana](https://asana.com/) with Rocket.Chat to boost team collaboration. Instead of duplicating Asana’s complex task creation, focus on contextual notifications and quick access to task updates. Rocket.Chat project management users can stay informed collaborating within Rocket.Chat, while complex workflows that are better handled by Asana's rich UI remains in Asana. The transition to and from Asana should be seamless.\n\n_Details:_\\*\n\n*   **Setup & Authentication**\n    \n    *   Implement OAuth and channel configuration.\n*   **Contextual Notifications**\n    \n    *   Real-time alerts for task updates and deadlines.\n*   **Quick Commands & Summaries**\n    \n    *   Slash commands for task details and simple updates.\n*   **Deep Linking**\n    \n    *   Direct links from notifications to tasks in Asana.\n*   **Optional Activity Feed**\n    \n    *   A mini feed for recent Asana activity in channels.\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Experience with Rocket.Chat Apps Engine (TypeScript)\n*   OAuth and REST API experience\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\n*   An app delivering userful integration workflows for project management teams collaborating on Rocket.Chat. Including minimally contextual task notifications and summaries.\n*   For workflows that are better handled with Asana's rich UI, seamless redirect to Asana and seamless return to the Rocket.Chat collaboration context (channel / thread / discussions).\n\n⏳ Project Duration: 90 hours (Small)\n\n📈 Difficulty: Easy/Intermediate\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔑 Passkey-Based WebAuthn Authentication for Rocket.Chat\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#-passkey-based-webauthn-authentication-for-rocketchat)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Julio Araujo, [Dnouv](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/Dnouv)\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nThe WebAuthn standard, now widely available on modern Android and iOS devices, enable convenient passwordless authentication satisfying 2FA (biometrics and \"have device\"). This project aims to integrate WebAuthn in Rocket.Chat authentication to offer a passwordless, secure login experience. The implementation needs to be aligned with Rocket.Chat’s existing authentication system while ensuring backward compatibility with all existing login methods.\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Node.js\n*   React.js\n*   WebAuthn API\n*   MongoDB\n*   Keen interest in cybersecurity\n*   Authentication & Security Best Practices\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\n*   Implement passkey-based authentication using WebAuthn\n*   Modify authentication modules to support passkey registration and login\n*   Update the frontend for seamless passkey interactions\n*   Ensure secure storage of public keys in the user database\n*   Conduct extensive testing across different devices and browsers\n*   Provide detailed documentation and community engagement\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 175 hours (Medium)\n\n* * *\n\n### Server Guide Agent\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#server-guide-agent)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Gabriel Casals, Jeffery Yu\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nAs a new user joins a Rocket.Chat server there is not much guidance on what to do or where to go.\n\nRight now, the only mechanism is a passive landing page that may display resources for each grouping (persona) of users.\n\nFor example, on the open.rocket.chat server, a user may be:\n\n*   A Rocket.Chat server administrators looking to connect with other administrators\n*   An end-user of Rocket.Chat looking to resolve problem or receive support information.\n*   A new community contributor looking for Google Summer of Code program information\n*   others\n\nEach one of these personas demand different style of conversation and would need to know about/join different sets of channels and other resources.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe project aims to replace the boring \"easy to miss, difficult to understand\" landing page, with an AI guide agent. This agent should start a conversation with the new user and then using modern LLM's discrimination/classification ability to positively identify the persona (users grouping/ sub-communities on a server) that the new user belongs to. The agent should continue to tune the conversation to the lingo-preferred of that persona, and finally guide the user to all the resources and channels available for that persona. This agent must be configurable (via Rocket.Chat Apps configuration) to handle any arbitrary persona and related resources set.\n\nRecommended Approach:\n\nThe agent should be able to add (and join) the appropriate channel for the new user, after confirming the action with the new user. A default/catch-all persona should be used to precisely scoped the project and ensure the LLM can converge onto a useful result. Since direct user input will be passed to the LLM for analysis, the agent MUST make sure that there is no prompt-injection possibility. Safety of server operation must be taken into account as this agent has ability to change the state of the server permanently.\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems\n*   Rocket.Chat Apps Engine (TypeScript)\n*   Rocket.Chat messaging APIs\n*   Advanced prompt engineering skills\n*   Experience with tools/function-calling capabilities of modern LLMs\n*   Understanding of how to implement \"safety first\" when creating AI apps that may permanently change the state of a production system\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\nAn AI Agent that will help to onboard new users.\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 175 hours (Medium)\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Code Review Assistant for Open Source projects\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#-code-review-assistant-for-open-source-projects)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Felipe Scuciatto, Samad Kahn\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nFinding reviewers for contributors' PRs on open source projects can often be difficult. Slow response can possibly result in the loss of a communtiy contributor.\n\nThis assistant will monitor new pull requests (either via incoming github integration messages in a channel or directly via github events) and identify the most suitable maintainer to review the PR based on a statistical scoring system. It will follow up with a friendly yet frequent reminder (“nagging”) mechanism to ensure timely reviews.\n\nAdditionally, the bot will leverage code-specialized LLMs to perform an initial review, automatically filtering out minor improvements before they reach human reviewers.\n\nThis will streamline the review process, reduce unnecessary delays, and ensure that only meaningful changes require manual attention.\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Rocket.Chat Apps Engine and TypeScript\n*   Knowledge of general statistics\n*   Prompt engineering with code-specialized LLMs\n*   Ideally GitHub API\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\n*   A Rocket.Chat App that will interact with open source maintainers and monitors open pull requests, assigns the most suitable reviewer based on past reviews, persistently reminds them until the review is completed, and leverages AI for initial code assessments.\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 175 hours (Medium)\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Embedded Chat 2025\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#-embedded-chat-2025)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Zishan Ahmad\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nImprovement to the EmbeddedChat project this year includes:\n\n*   Upgrading the current API and auth packages to use the latest Rocket.Chat SDK packages like `ddp-client`, and aligning other components to use other abstraction provided by Rocket.Chat, ensuring these packages will be managed internally moving forward.\n*   Making the EmbeddedChat fully mobile-responsive for a seamless experience across all devices.\n*   Improving the UI and adding more customization options to enhance the user experience.\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\nReact.Js\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\n*   Integration of the latest Rocket.Chat SDK packages\n*   Fully mobile-responsive EmbeddedChat\n*   Improved UI with more customization options\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 90 hours (Small)\n\n📈 **Difficulty:** Easy/Intermediate\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Receipts Processor and Reporting App powered by Multi-modal LLMs\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#-receipts-processor-and-reporting-app-powered-by-multi-modal-llms)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Maria Khelli, Sing Li\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nWhile attending a busy conferences or event, the need to keep track of receipts and then having to adding them up manually to fill in expense reports is a very common and tedious problem. This project is a Rocket.Chat app that completely automate the process.\n\nDetails:\n\n*   The user will be able to take pictures of restaurant receipts on their phone and upload it into a specific channel (representing a single event, duration of time, or trip, and so on...).\n    \n*   Upon request, the app should read and sum all the receipts producing a detailed report. Ideally, the input format and image size should be flexible and the report format should be customizable via templates.\n    \n*   The app should never produce erraneous result under any circumstances, it should be able to recognize its limitation and decline to complete the task instead of giving potentially erraneous output.\n    \n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Rocket.Chat Apps Engine (TypeScript)\n*   Intermediate prompt engineering Skills\n*   Experience with image reasoning capabilities of available open source multi-modal LLMs\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\nA working Rocket.Chat app that will scan and sum all the restaurant receipts uploaded to a specific channel.\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 175 hours (Medium)\n\n📈 **Difficulty:** Easy/Intermediate\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡 Perfect AI Docs Assistant App\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#-perfect-ai-docs-assistant-app)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** [Dnouv](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/Dnouv), Jeffery Yu\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nThis project aims to build a Rocket.Chat App that provides a **natural language interface** for querying Rocket.Chat Docs (docs.rocket.chat). Instead of manually searching for answers, users can simply ask the app, and it will return a **perfect, relevant response** extracted and summarized from the documentation.\n\nFor the very small dataset that we are working with, we aim to tune and optimize the well-known RAG agentic workflow for our specific purpose; ideally producing **an optimized and perfect Ask the Docs Assistant** for this subset of the Rocket.Chat documentation.\n\nConsider possibly:\n\n*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agentic workflow** the AI/ML design pattern we're all familiar with\n*   **Local embedding model** needs to run in memory/CPU for maximum efficiency\n*   **In-memory vector store** run in the client with no persistence, subject of further optimization (chunking, match-selection, metadata) to tune for _perfect results_\n*   **Context-aware follow-up responses** not required but nice to have\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Rocket.Chat Apps Engine (TypeScript)\n*   Modern agentic workflows (including classic-RAG)\n*   Web Storage & IndexedDB (for caching, if needed)\n*   Intermediate prompt engineering\n*   Keen interest in contemporary applications of LLMs\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\n*   generation/creation of a perfect validation dataset, consisting of (1500, 5000, 10000) queriies and corresponding answer, that will be used in the benchmark/validation of the final assistant\n*   a fine-tuned compact LLM to be used in the last stage of the RAG agentic workflow (fine-tuned minimally on the dataset above)\n*   the perfect \"ask the docs assistant\" for our small dataset, running mostly on the client without heavy compute overhead, ideally scoring 90% plus on the benchmark\n\n_(we like to thank our early community for helping us to fine-tune this set of deliverables)_\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 90 hours (Small)\n\n📈 **Difficulty:** Intermediate/Advanced\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡Google Summer of Code Community Hub 2025\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#google-summer-of-code-community-hub-2025)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Anjaneya Gupta\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nContinuing our work on a \"full stack component framework\" in which a scalable website can be created by non-technical users using drag-and-drop components that not only include UI and client-side logic, but also pre-scaled server-side behaviors (or serverless impl).\n\nThe ultimate use-case we have been working on is the community hub for Rocket.Chat Google Summer of Code. It will link all the despearate servers into one easy to customize and maintain uniform scalable web app (comprise of a set of full-stack components).\n\nThis year's work will include:\n\n*   rebasing of the existing platform and components on Svelte 5\n*   moving the WYSIWYG \"Syntax Sweetening\" work done last year to this new platform\n*   implementation of auth via OIDC\n*   migrate over the event poster component (used for our demo day)\n*   migrate over the video-meet-your-mentor component\n*   implement the gsoc leaderboard component\n*   implement embeddedchat component\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Advanced Typescript\n*   Svelte 5\n*   AST concepts\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\nA functional community hub website that we will use for 2026; showcasing the platform and new components.\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 90 hours (Small)\n\n📈 **Difficulty:** Easy/Intermediate\n\n* * *\n\n### 💡AI Chat Workflows Automation App with multi-step reasoning\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#ai-chat-workflows-automation-app-with-multi-step-reasoning)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** Hardik Bhatia\n\n💬 **Description:**\n\nBuild a Rocket.Chat app that will monitor messages in specified channels (possibly sent by specified individuals, possibly within certain specified time period, and so on... ) and then (as a second step) perform additional messaging operations based on those messages. Command should be issued in simple English. Bonus point for more than 2 steps in the reasoning.\n\nSome examples:\n\n```\n\"whenever @sing.li posts any welcome messages in #gsoc2025, immediately DM him with a thank-you note\"\n\n\"if any picture is uploaded to the #pets channel, send a message that says meow! if the pet is a cat, and a woof! otherwise\"\n\n\"whenever a message is posted that contains a four letter word beginning with letter F, delete that message immediately\"\n\n\"if my wife messaged with 'arrived' before I do, DM her sorry I will be late after 1 minute\" \n```\n\nRecommended approach:\n\n*   leverage the latest open source specialized multi-step reasoning LLMs such as the DeepSeek distilled models\n*   make intelligent use of tools/function-calling and structured inference\n*   be sure to built in safety to offset erraneous output and/or hallucinations\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:**\n\n*   Rocket.Chat Apps Engine (TypeScript)\n*   Rocket.Chat messaging APIs\n*   Advanced prompt engineering Skills\n*   Experience with image reasoning capabilities of available open source multi-modal LLMs\n*   Experience working with multi-step reasoning LLMs\n*   Experience with tools/function-calling capabilities of modern LLMs\n*   Expereince with code generation and code completion LLMs\n*   Understanding of how to implement \"safety first\" when creating AI apps that may permenantly change the state of a production system\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**\n\nPlatform for generating functional automated chat workflows using LLMs.\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 90 hours (Small)\n\n📈 **Difficulty:** Intermediate/Advanced\n\n* * *\n\n### 📅 Message Timestamp Date Picker Components\n\n[](https://github.com/RocketChat/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/google-summer-of-code-2025.md#--message-timestamp-date-picker-components)\n\n👥 **Mentor(s):** [Martin Schoeler](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/martin.schoeler)\n\n💬 **Description:** Currently Rocket.Chat has a feature that allows users to send timestamps on messages, but not in an intuitive way. To send a timestamp you need to manually write it down with the correct date code. For example `<t:1732557600:t>`. This feature was added for Rocket.Chat Apps engine, but users can benefit from this too. The objective of this project is to create a new `MessageToolBar` item that displays a calendar and let the users select the date and time they would like to share, both in the desktop app and mobile apps.\n\nSome examples of the usage of the timestamp feature (you can test them today on the open.rocket.chat server!)\n\nPattern: <t:{timestamp}:?{format}\\>\n\n*   {timestamp} is a Unix timestamp\n*   {format} is an optional parameter that can be used to customize the date and time format.\n\n**Formats**\n\n| Format | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `t` | Short time | 12:00 AM |\n| `T` | Long time | 12:00:00 AM |\n| `d` | Short date | 12/31/2020 |\n| `D` | Long date | Thursday, December 31, 2020 |\n| `f` | Full date and time | Thursday, December 31, 2020 12:00 AM |\n| `F` | Full date and time (long) | Thursday, December 31, 2020 12:00:00 AM |\n| `R` | Relative time | 1 year ago |\n\nThe creation of tests for the new component is also expected, both end to end and unit if applicable.\n\n💪 **Desired Skills:** React, Typescript, React Native\n\n🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:** A new component on the `MessageToolBar` that allows users to add timestamps to their messages, both in desktop and mobile.\n\n⏳ **Project Duration:** 90 hours.
