Project ideas where no contributor has yet contacted mentors should be listed as ‘need contributor’. Project ideas where one or more potential contributors are communicating with mentors should have a status of ‘potential contributors’. You can still communicate your interest to mentors to apply to projects with status “potential contributor” – that implies that there is another contributor who has already shown some capability for that project (see below for more details on how we evaluate applications). Projects that need to identify another mentor (e.g. to find a mentor with a specific skill, or from a different institution) should be marked with a status of ‘need mentor’ and the idea page should provide details in the ‘Mentors’ section.\n\nAll contributor applications will be discussed by the R mentor community, and proposals will be ranked considering factors such as quality, difficulty, and impact for the R community. Slots are a finite resource granted to R by Google, and only the best proposals will get chosen. In prior years, R has received 4-5 times more applications than slots, so application quality is key.\n\nContributors, if you have an idea for an R package coding project that is not listed above, please [try to find mentors by posting a description of your project idea on the r-gsoc google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gsoc-r). If you find mentors, feel free to add your project idea to this wiki. You should NOT submit any project applications to Google without finding TWO mentors for your project proposal.\n\n[](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/_Footer/_edit \"Edit footer\")\n\nAkshat Maurya, [**GitHub Profile**](https://github.com/akshat09867), [**Test Results**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12CM8Ud6rCcnOZ9mJUWS0wHPb5NlrcQDRyCQAlMXI-5g/edit?usp=sharing)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects#akshat-maurya-github-profile-test-results)\n\n### Toggle table of contents Pages 20\n\n*   Loading\n    \n    [Home](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [Admin application](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/Admin-application)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [Animated interactive ggplots](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/Animated-interactive-ggplots)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [application template](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/application-template)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [data.table](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/data.table)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [DBmaps R Package Development](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/DBmaps-R-Package-Development)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [ecotourism: data package containing tourism records and endangered wildlife reports](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/ecotourism:-data-package-containing-tourism-records-and-endangered-wildlife-reports)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [grepreaper R Package Development](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/grepreaper-R-Package-Development)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [Improving the performance of multivariate normal models in dirichletprocess](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/Improving-the-performance-of-multivariate-normal-models-in-dirichletprocess)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [imputeTestbench for multivariate time series](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/imputeTestbench-for-multivariate-time-series)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [MENTORS COPY THIS TEMPLATE](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/MENTORS-COPY-THIS-TEMPLATE)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [Optimizing a performance testing workflow by reusing minified R package versions between CI runs](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/Optimizing-a-performance-testing-workflow-by-reusing-minified-R-package-versions-between-CI-runs)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [R GSOC FAQ](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/R-GSOC-FAQ)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [r2sbml (An interface to SBML in R)](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/r2sbml-(An-interface-to-SBML-in-R))\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [substances](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/substances)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [sundialr (Package for solving ODEs in R)](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/sundialr-(Package-for-solving-ODEs-in-R))\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [table of proposed coding projects](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [time dependent constraints in gfpop](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/time-dependent-constraints-in-gfpop)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [torchvision in R improvements](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/torchvision-in-R-improvements)\n    \n*   Loading\n    \n    [Updates in VedicDateTime R Package](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/Updates-in-VedicDateTime-R-Package)\n    \n*   Show 5 more pages…\n\n[Add a custom sidebar](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2025/wiki/_new?wiki%5Bname%5D=_Sidebar)\n\n##### Clone this wiki locally\n\nFooter\n------\n\n[](https://github.com/ \"GitHub\")© 2025 GitHub, Inc.\n\n### Footer navigation\n\n*   [Terms](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)\n*   [Privacy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)\n*   [Security](https://github.com/security)\n*   [Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)\n*   [Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n*   [Contact](https://support.github.com/?tags=dotcom-footer)\n*   Manage cookies\n*   Do not share my personal information\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.\n"}
