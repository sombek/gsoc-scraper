One of the main [project goals](https://neovim.io/charter/) is to encourage hacking and collaboration.\n\n*   Project ideas for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) are tracked as [issues with the \"gsoc\" label](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/labels/gsoc).\n*   These projects may require familiarity with C, Lua, and Vimscript.\n*   Documentation for Neovim developers is here: [https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html](https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html)\n\nThe Neovim source has roots going back to 1987 which means libraries such as [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) were not around at that time. The codebase can be made easier to maintain and understand by using these libraries. Project ideas that involve working heavily with internals will in general be more difficult than project ideas that \"simply\" add new features. However working with older/complex parts of the code base can also provide valuable learning feedback for writing simpler and more maintainable code.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#getting-started)\n\nProposals are tracked as [issues with the \"gsoc\" label](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/labels/gsoc). We are happy to hear other ideas you may have, just create a new issue and mention that it's for GSoC. Also visit [https://neovim.io/#chat](https://neovim.io/#chat) to discuss GSoC projects with the community and our mentors. Because communication is a big part of open source development you are expected to get in touch with us before making your application.\n\nTo get familiar with the project, try a small coding task (choose from [complexity:low](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acomplexity%3Alow) issues).\n\nMaking a proposal\n-----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#making-a-proposal)\n\nThe application period for GSOC is March 24 - April 8 ([Timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)). Send your proposal through the official [GSOC page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6095582066638848/). We encourage students to send a first draft early in this period, this allows us to give feedback and and ask for more information if need. See [https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal) for some guidelines.\n\nNote: this year we will likely accept 1-2 students. We expect to get more strong proposals than available slots, so we will need to turn some good proposals down.\n\nProposal evaluation\n-------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#proposal-evaluation)\n\nProposal evaluation criteria:\n\n[http://intermine.org/internships/guidance/grading-criteria-2019/](http://intermine.org/internships/guidance/grading-criteria-2019/)\n\nTips\n----\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#tips)\n\n*   Anywhere a Vim concept (such as \"textlock\") is mentioned, you can find what it means by using the `:help` command from within neovim (`:help textlock`).\n*   Ask questions and post your partial work frequently (every 1-2 days, if possible). It's OK if work is messy; just mark the pull request (PR) as \"Draft\".\n*   Take advantage of the continuous integration (CI) systems which automatically run against your pull requests. When you send work to a PR, the full test-suite runs on the PR while you continue to work locally.\n*   `:help dev-tools` contains up-to-date documentation on building, debugging, and development tips.\n*   Only a text editor, `cmake`, and a compiler are needed to develop Neovim. LSP or [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) is very helpful also.\n*   The [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are intended to be helpful, not rigid.\n\nGSoC Ideas 2025\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#gsoc-ideas-2025)\n\nProposals are [tracked as issues](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/labels/gsoc)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#proposals-are-tracked-as-issues)\n\nChoose an [existing issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/labels/gsoc), or propose an idea by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).\n\nAI primitives\n-------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#ai-primitives)\n\n*   Size: 175 hours\n*   Difficulty: Medium\n*   Desirable Skills:\n    *   Lua\n*   Code license: Apache 2.0\n*   Mentor: Justin M.

For example:\n\n*   Support `textDocument/inlineCompletion` from the LSP 3.18 spec.\n*   Add a way to mark a buffer or window as \"busy\" or \"in progress\", that works with the default statusline (and custom statuslines).\n*   Add a \"progress meter\" interface to the Nvim standard library.\n*   Improvements to the \"prompt buffer\" concept\n    *   multiline input\n    *   paste into the prompt\n    *   a builtin \"filetype\" with standard highlighting\n    *   standard headers with distinctive highlighting\n    *   standard mappings\n*   ...?\n\n\":restart\" command\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#restart-command)\n\n*   Size: 90 hours\n*   Difficulty: Medium\n*   Desirable Skills:\n    *   C\n    *   Lua\n*   Code license: Apache 2.0\n*   Mentor: Justin M.

Or when a `:terminal` buffer is closed, its contents can't be reloaded.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n\n*   `:terminal` buffer contents can be saved to the filesystem.\n*   User has a way to view saved terminal buffers and reload them.\n*   Visiting a \"mark\" in a terminal buffer reloads the terminal buffer if it's not loaded.\n*   `:terminal` buffers optionally are included in Nvim \"session\" files and restored when the session is reloaded.\n\n\"Remote SSH\" features\n---------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#remote-ssh-features)\n\n*   Size: 350 hours\n*   Difficulty: Medium\n*   Desirable Skills:\n    *   Lua\n*   Code license: Apache 2.0\n*   Mentor: Justin M.

The existing visual-mode in Nvim could be enhanced to support this in Nvim.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n\nVisual-mode in Nvim becomes more intuitive and useful:\n\n*   it can be repeated with dot (.)\n*   introduce a modifier similar to `v`, except normal-mode commands work in this mode, after the \"selection\" is chosen.\n\nGUI Features\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#gui-features)\n\n*   Size: 175 hours\n*   Difficulty: Medium-Hard\n*   Desirable Skills:\n    *   C and related tools\n    *   Familiar with event-loop programming model\n*   Code license: Apache 2.0\n*   Mentor: Justin M. Keyes ([@justinmk](http://github.com/justinmk))\n\n**Description:**\n\nNvim GUIs are implemented as processes communicating with Nvim. Originally the UI protocol exposed most functionality as a single, terminal-like screen grid. Work has been done to allow UIs (including embeddings in GUI editors, like VSCode) to render the screen layout themselves, based on semantic updates from Nvim. Some screen elements like the cmdline, popupmenu and message area has been externalized. As a result of a 2018 [GSOC project](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8320), windows can be drawn on separate grids.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n\nFurther improvements to the GUI protocol.\n\nSome UIs want to render the buffer contents themselves. A solution would be a UI protocol mode, where the rendered grid is not used, rather all decorations, such as syntax highlighting, conceals, virtual text are transmitted for the current viewport. Such an UI would be able to render text without the restrictions of the builtin monospace grid. Then the UI should be able to inform nvim about usage of virtual columns and wrapping, so that vim commands such as `gj` are consistent with how text is presented to the user.\n\nAnother path is to improve the core Nvim grid model. We could allow the width and height of cells be different for each row. This would allow for heading text with different font size, and pictures rendered inside windows.\n\nPutting forward your own ideas of UI improvements is encouraged. Read the [docs](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/doc/ui.txt) for the implemented extensions as well as the [tracking issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/9421) for ongoing/planned work, as a starting point.\n\nIDE \"Vim mode\"\n--------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#ide-vim-mode)\n\n*   Size: 175 hours\n*   Difficulty: Medium\n*   Desirable Skills:\n    *   Familiar with RPC\n*   Code license: Apache 2.0\n*   Mentor: Justin M.

Similar to Python's [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) module, the idea is to to offload Nvim tasks (VimL and/or Lua) to child Nvim processes.\n\nHere's a picture of the potential workflow:\n\n1.  parent calls `invoke_async(Foo)`\n2.  parent spawns new child `nvim` process\n3.  parent sends command name `Foo` + state to child\n4.  parent does other, unrelated work\n5.  child completes its `Foo` work\n6.  child sends notification (method name + state) to parent\n\n**Difficulty:** Hard\n\n**Code license:** Apache 2.0\n\n**Mentor:** Justin M Keyes ([@justinmk](http://github.com/justinmk))\n\n([DONE](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/10071)) TUI (Terminal UI) remote attachment\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#done-tui-terminal-ui-remote-attachment)\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe built-in UI is called the TUI. It looks like Vim, but internally it is decoupled from the UI and \"screen\" layout subsystem. It was designed to be able to connect to other (remote) instances of Nvim, but this hasn't been implemented yet. [#7438](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7438)\n\nNvim is both a server and a client. Nvim (client) can connect to any other Nvim (server). And Nvim [GUIs](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects#gui) can show the screen of a remote Nvim server.\n\nBut the built-in Nvim TUI cannot show the screen of a remote Nvim server. That's the goal of this project.\n\n*   It is not \"live share\". It's just showing the remote UI in a client TUI.\n*   Networking question are out of scope. It is assumed the client has an SSH tunnel or named pipe to connect to.\n\nThe Nvim API model is:\n\n*   `:help api`: general API functions\n*   `:help ui`: UI events\n*   Any client can call any API function.\n*   If a client calls `nvim_ui_attach`, then it is a \"UI client\". This simply means that Nvim will send UI events as msgpack-rpc notifications on the channel.\n\nThat's how _every_ Nvim UI works. And that's how the TUI client (this project proposal) will work.\n\nPython \"demo UI\" may be helpful: [https://github.com/neovim/python-gui](https://github.com/neovim/python-gui)\n\nThe simplest UI is the \"fake UI\" implemented in `test/functional/ui/screen.lua` from the Nvim test suite. It creates a text UI from real Nvim UI events. This allows us to write Lua tests that check the state of the UI, by simply writing the text UI in the test. In the Neoivm repo, \"git grep 'screen:expect'\" shows all of the places where this is used.\n\nThe `example_spec.lua` test shows a simple example. You can try it by running this shell command:\n\n```\nTEST_FILE=test/functional/example_spec.lua make functionaltest\n```\n\nOverview of the `screen.lua` \"fake UI\" implementation:\n\n*   `Screen._wait()` / `Screen:sleep()` runs the event loop to consume UI events\n*   `Screen:_redraw()` dispatches UI events to the appropriate handlers\n*   For example `Screen:_handle_grid_line()` consumes a line event, and updates some tables (self.\\_grids and self.\\_attr\\_table).\n    *   And those tables are literally the contents of the fake UI that `Screen:expect()` tests against.\n\nUse cases:\n\n*   Connect to any Nvim. Unlike tmux, Nvim UI client can connect to any other running Nvim, including GUIs.\n*   Potential for using `libnvim` as the RPC core of any Nvim API client, to eliminate the need for clients to implement their own msgpack-RPC handling.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n\nImplement a TUI \"remote UI\" client. Modify the TUI subsystem so that it can display a remote Nvim instance. The C codebase already has msgpack support, an event-loop, and the ability to connect to sockets/named pipes/etc.\n\n*   Extend `tui/tui.c` to:\n    1.  connect to a channel\n    2.  get UI events from the channel\n    3.  unpack the events and call the appropriate handlers\n*   Extend `tui/input.c` to:\n    1.  send user input to the channel (i.e. call the nvim\\_input() API function)\n\nExample:\n\nwill connect to the Nvim server at address `foo`. The `nvim` client instance sends input to the remote Nvim server, and reflects the UI of the remote Nvim server. So the `nvim` client acts like any other external (G)UI.\n\n**Difficulty:** Medium\n\n**Code license:** Apache 2.0\n\n**Mentor:** Justin M Keyes ([@justinmk](http://github.com/justinmk)), Björn Linse ([@bfredl](http://github.com/bfredl))\n\n* * *\n\nGSoC Ideas 2018\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#gsoc-ideas-2018)\n\n([DONE](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8707)) UI protocol improvements\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#done-ui-protocol-improvements)\n\n**Description:**\n\nNvim GUI:s are implemented as processes communicating with Nvim over a protocol. Currently this protocol exposes most functionality as a terminal-like screen grid. A long term goal is enabling richer UIs (including embeddings in GUI editors, like VSCode) by refactoring the protocol towards semantic updates and letting the GUI actually draw buffer contents and other screen elements. Currently this has been implemented for a few specific elements, like the completion popup menu and the command line.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n\nThe UI protocol has gained new capabilities. This could involve substantial changes such as the GUI receiving redraw updates for each window separately, so that the GUI could be responsible for managing the overall layout of windows and statuslines.\n\nAlternatively, improvements could be done within the current global screen grid, such as the ability to display grid-aligned images in signs, buffers and statuslines. It could also involve adding semantic information to the grid, so that GUI:s can identify screen elements reliably rather than guessing it from highlights.\n\n*   Code license: Apache 2.0\n\n**Difficulty:**\n\nMedium to Hard\n\n**Student:** ([@UtkarshMe](https://github.com/UtkarshMe))\n\n**Mentor:** Björn Linse ([@bfredl](http://github.com/bfredl))\n\nJava client\n-----------\n\n[](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code#java-client)\n\n**Desirable Skills:**\n\n*   Familiar with Vim/Nvim and Vim script (VimL)\n*   Moderate/High experience in Java\n*   Familiar with event-loop programming model\n\n**Description:**\n\nImplement a Nvim [API client](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects#api-clients) using Java.\n\nImplement a client, written in Java, which allows Java applications to control Nvim using the Nvim RPC API.
