The below links refer to these issues, where you can find more information about the package, the project, the task, and the expected outcomes. While QC-Devs supports quite a few packages (we released 7 in the last 12 months!), each year we select a few to focus on, as this makes it easier for mentors to engage with participants.\n\n| Project | Hours | Difficulty |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [AtomDB: Refactor Database Structure](https://github.com/theochem/AtomDB/issues/141) | 175 | ðŸ¤” |\n| [Gbasis: Improve Performance Using Screening](https://github.com/theochem/gbasis/issues/207) | 350 | ðŸ¤” |\n| [GBasis: Arbitrary-Order Overlap Integrals + Applications](https://github.com/theochem/gbasis/issues/183) | 350 | ðŸ˜° |\n| [Grid: Integration on the Sphere Using Maximum Determinant Points](https://github.com/theochem/grid/issues/237) | 90 | ðŸ¤“ |\n| [Grid: Adaptive Molecular Quadrature](https://github.com/theochem/grid/issues/262) | 175 | ðŸ¤” |\n| [Grid: Transformed Cubic Grids](https://github.com/theochem/grid/issues/264) | 175 | ðŸ¤” |\n| [Grid: Improve Robustness of Poisson Solver](https://github.com/theochem/grid/issues/263) | 350 | ðŸ¤” |\n| [ModelHamiltonian: Manipulating Model Hamiltonians and Building Interfaces to External Packages](https://github.com/theochem/ModelHamiltonian/issues/148) | 350 | ðŸ˜° |\n| [ModelHamiltonian: An Alternative Approach to Spin Hamiltonians](https://github.com/theochem/ModelHamiltonian/issues/150) | 90 | ðŸ¤” |\n| [NICE.jl: Add Exact Solver for Chemical Kinetics](https://github.com/theochem/NICE.jl/issues/8) | 175 | ðŸ¤” |\n\nContributor Guidance\n--------------------\n\n*   [QC-Devs GSoC Contributor Guidance.](https://github.com/theochem/guidelines/blob/main/GSoC.md)\n*   [QC-Devs community health files, including our code-of-conduct and contribution guidelines](https://github.com/theochem/.github)\n\nPrevious Projects\n-----------------\n\n*   A web interface for the [`Selector`](https://selector.qcdevs.org/intro.html) package.
