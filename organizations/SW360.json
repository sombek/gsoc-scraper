A scenario where a package (say “mylib-v1.2”) was scanned by FOSSology and cleaned by a clearing team. The new version of the package (say “mylib-v1.5”) was released and uploaded again to FOSSology for clearing. Now, another metric can be generated showing the files from both packages against the change in licensing per file (addition, removal, change of license or new file).\n\nThis either can be shown in FOSSology itself, but also when doing an initial scan report (ISR), triggered from SW360. Then it would be very visible for the requester if there are changes in the new version of the release or not. Also, the diff could be shown in the CLI files.\n\nIt can generate a table like:\n\n| File path | mylib-v1.2 | mylib-v1.5 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| path/to/file | MIT | MIT |\n| path/to/file2 | MIT,BSD | MIT |\n| path/to/file3 | GPL-2.0 | GPL-3.0 |\n| path/to/new-file |  | BSD |\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\*\\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\* |\n| Project size | Medium |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/professional |\n| Skills needed | XML, Java |\n| Contact | @EttingerK @GMishx |\n\n### Improve integration with FOSSology\n\n**Goal:** Use extended REST API of FOSSology to improve the “Send to FOSSology” feature\n\nSW360 already have ways to interact with [FOSSology](https://fossology.org/), however the interaction as of now is very limited. The idea is to expand on this interaction and make use of extended [REST API of FOSSology](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/www/ui/api/documentation/openapiv2.yaml) and have features like:\n\n*   Upload source to FOSSology\n*   Search and link to existing sources with checksum match\n*   Reuse previous version of release uploaded/existing in FOSSology\n*   Provide option to select agents for scanning in FOSSology\n*   Fetch different kind of reports from FOSSology, not just SPDX\n\nRelevant information:\n\n*   FOSSology REST API: [https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/www/ui/api/documentation/openapiv2.yaml](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/www/ui/api/documentation/openapiv2.yaml)\n*   SW360 existing endpoints: `releases/{id}/checkFossologyProcessStatus`\n*   SW360 existing endpoints: `releases/{id}/triggerFossologyProcess`\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\*\\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\*\\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\* |\n| Project size | Large |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/professional |\n| Skills needed | Java, REST & HTTP libraries |\n| Contact | @GMishx, @rudra-superrr |\n\n### Thrift layer removal\n\n**Goal:** Remove thrift layer for communication with Database\n\nRemove thrift layer which is used to interact with DB as it is not required and makes the installation process of SW360 unnecessarily complex. This change will help project moving forward with modern architectures like microservices.\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\* |\n| Project size | Large |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/professional |\n| Skills needed | Java, CouchDB |\n| Contact | @GMishx @smrutis1 @heliocastro |\n\n### Improve tests for all REST API endpoints\n\n**Goal:** Improve existing tests for all REST API endpoints and write new tests\n\nWrite unit and integration tests for all REST API endpoints. This will help in improving the code quality and make the project more robust.\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\* |\n| Project size | Medium |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/professional |\n| Skills needed | Java, JUnit, REST API |\n| Contact | @GMishx @heliocastro @keerthi-bl |\n\n### SBOM based recommendation\n\n**Goal:** Recommendation of packages based on SBOM of a project\n\nWhen a user imports a SBOM file, the tool will share the information about the cleared & uncleared packages used in that project based on existing knowledge available in SW360. In addition to that if any package is uncleared,\n\n1.  The tool will recommend equivalent package, which is already cleared in SW360, which in turn will reduce the project clearing time.\n2.  If the user still wants to use the same uncleared package, the tool will give an estimated time to clear the package as well as the project using reports like ISR.\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\*\\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\*\\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\* |\n| Project size | Large |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/professional |\n| Skills needed | Java, Python, AI/ML |\n| Contact | @amritkv @GMishx |\n\n### Creating Project as a Service\n\n**Goal:** Separate out the Project and related modules as a separate microservice\n\nThe idea is to separate the Project related modules as a separate microservice which can then be customized independently for different organizations while still reusing the common Component repository.\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Project size | Large |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/professional |\n| Skills needed | Java, Spring, Microservices, REST |\n| Contact | @keerthi-bl @GMishx @heliocastro |\n"}
