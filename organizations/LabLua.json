Teal is a statically typed language that compiles to Lua (Teal is to Lua somewhat like TypeScript is to JavaScript). Since Teal is essentially a superset of Lua, this tool should be useful for Lua as well. There is prior art for Lua (LuaDoc, LDoc), but the community would benefit from a Teal-specific tool that is able to make use of its type annotations as possibly integrate better with language servers in modern editors.\n\n#### Expected results\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#expected-results)\n\n*   a CLI tool that generates Markdown from Teal or Lua comments and Teal type annotations\n*   support for generating HTML, possibly using templating systems (possibly reusing LDoc code)\n*   stretch goal: integration with other existing tooling such as the vscode-teal plugin and LuaRocks\n*   stretch goal: extensibility for supporting more languages in the Lua ecosystem\n\n#### Tools\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#tools)\n\n*   [Teal](https://teal-language.org/)\n*   any Lua libraries needed\n*   [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/)\n\n#### Skill level\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#skill-level)\n\n*   Intermediate\n\n#### Project size\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#project-size)\n\n*   Large (350 hours)\n\n#### Mentor\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#mentor)\n\n*   [Hisham Muhammad](mailto:h@hisham.hm)\n\n* * *\n\n### Lunatik binding for Human Interface Devices (HID) drivers\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#lunatik-binding-for-human-interface-devices-hid-drivers)\n\n[Lunatik](https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik/) is a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua. For example, Lunatik can be used for scripting the Linux networking subsystem (as presented at Netdev [0x14](https://netdevconf.info/0x14/session.html?talk-linux-network-scripting-with-lua) and [0x17](https://netdevconf.info/0x17/sessions/talk/scripting-the-linux-routing-table-with-lua.html)) among other [examples](https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik#examples).\n\nThe purpose of this project is to create a Lunatik library for binding the [Linux HID APIs](https://docs.kernel.org/hid/index.html) to allow developers to write new HID drivers using Lua. This project might leverage the [Lunatik device library](https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik#device), which allows the creation of character device drivers using Lua. Moreover, this project should also port the [Nvidia Shield HID driver](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/hid/hid-nvidia-shield.c) to Lua.\n\n#### Expected results\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#expected-results-1)\n\n*   Lunatik HID library\n*   Nvidia Shield HID driver in Lua\n*   Benchmark comparison between Nvidia Shield HID driver and its Lua implementation\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#prerequisites)\n\n*   Lua and C programming languages\n*   Experience with the Lua-C API (highly desirable)\n*   Experience with Linux kernel (highly desirable)\n\n#### Skill level\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#skill-level-1)\n\n*   Challenging\n\n#### Project size\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#project-size-1)\n\n*   Large (350 hours)\n\n#### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#mentors)\n\n*   [Lourival Vieira Neto](mailto:lourival.neto@gmail.com)\n\n* * *\n\n### Port Lua Test Suite to Lunatik\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#port-lua-test-suite-to-lunatik)\n\n[Lunatik](https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik/) is a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua.

That is, to adapt scripts from the Lua Test Suite and develop a Linux loadable kernel module containing its C portion. This project might leverage the [GSoC 2015 project](http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/blog2015.html#kerneltest) developed by [Guilherme Salazar](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc/blob/main/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2a4d59506a4b49470445584d), which ported the Lua Test Suite to the [NetBSD kernel](https://man.netbsd.org/lua.4).\n\nThe main difference between the kernel Lua and regular user-level Lua is that kernel Lua doesn't have support for standard libraries that depend on operating system (e.g., io and os) and for floating-point numbers.\n\n#### Expected results\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#expected-results-2)\n\n*   Adapted test scripts for Lunatik\n*   Lunatik library for testing the Lua C API\n*   Test Report at least for x86\\_64 and ARM64\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#prerequisites-1)\n\n*   Lua and C programming languages\n*   Experience with the Lua-C API (nice to have)\n*   Experience with Linux kernel (nice to have)\n\n#### Skill level\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#skill-level-2)\n\n*   Intermediate\n\n#### Project size\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#project-size-2)\n\n*   Medium (175 hours)\n\n#### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#mentors-1)\n\n*   [Guilherme Salazar](mailto:gsz@acm.org)\n*   [Lourival Vieira Neto](mailto:lourival.neto@gmail.com)\n\n* * *\n\n### Lunatik package for Linux distros\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#lunatik-package-for-linux-distros)\n\n[Lunatik](https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik/) is a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua.

The latter library, [luasystem](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem), provides the primitives to handle terminal operations, albeit they are fundamentally different on Posix and Windows based systems.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to create a new library that builds on [luasystems terminal primitives](https://lunarmodules.github.io/luasystem/topics/03-terminal.md.html) to build basic UI elements for user interaction in a cross-platform way. This should not be anything like curses, but the simpler user interactions like;\n\n*   progress indicators/bars\n*   prompts; yes/no, ok/cancel\n*   reading line inputs; reading a filename or other strings\n*   hidden inputs; for secrets\n*   headers and footers (basics for full-screen apps)\n*   More complex full screen app support (panels, drawing/re-drawing)\n*   etc.\n\n### Things to consider\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#things-to-consider)\n\nThe library should be general purpose, adhering the the Lua principle of 'mechanisms over policies'. This means for example that it should be possible to use it sync as well as async (coroutines), and it shouldn't force control over the main application loop, etc. A developer using the library should be able to make his/her own choice.\n\nBesides that terminals are challenging to work with. There are many control codes to control the terminal, however querying the terminal is very limited. There is no way to request current color status or cursor visibility for example.\n\n#### Expected results\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#expected-results-4)\n\n*   API that makes it easy to work around terminal limitations\n*   API design with consistency across platforms\n*   a new library build on top of LuaSystem\n*   works on Windows and Posix\n*   Documentation and examples\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#prerequisites-3)\n\n*   Lua programming language\n*   Experience with terminals (nice to have)\n\n#### Skill level\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#skill-level-4)\n\n*   Beginner\n\n#### Project size\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#project-size-4)\n\n*   Medium (175 hours)\n\n#### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#mentors-3)\n\n*   [Thijs Schreijer](mailto:thijs@thijsschreijer.nl)\n\n* * *\n\n### Conntrack and NAT support for Lunatik\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#conntrack-and-nat-support-for-lunatik)\n\nConnection tracking (conntrack) is a fundamental component of the Linux kernel's networking stack. It is part of the Netfilter framework and is responsible for monitoring active network connections passing through the system. Conntrack maintains a state table, allowing the kernel to track packets as part of a flow and apply connection-oriented filtering, NAT (Network Address Translation), and stateful firewalling.\n\nNAT is used to modify IP addresses and ports in packet headers to facilitate address translation, load balancing, and security enforcement. The Linux kernel provides APIs to manipulate NAT and connection tracking through the Netfilter framework.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to port conntrack and NAT data structures and kernel APIs to lunatik. These are present under:\n\n*   `net/netfilter/conntrack.h`\n*   `net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_common.h`\n*   `net/netfilter/conntrack_tuple.h`\n*   `net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.h`\n*   `net/netfilter/nf_nat.h`\n\nThis projects builds upon the GSoC 2024 Project ['Lunatik binding for Netfilter'](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2024/projects/BIJAPZjf). For complete reference on the relevant kernel headers and data structures, refer to the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/sheharyaar/cbbd43037fa43fd391e52964347a2bc9).\n\n#### Expected results\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#expected-results-5)\n\n*   Allow fetching the conntrack entries and connection information\n*   Ability to conntrack add entries from lua programs that need to perform NAT. Example use case - L7 load balancing using netfilter in lua\n*   Ability to perform NAT for atleast inet protocols\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#prerequisites-4)\n\n*   Lua and C programming languages\n*   Linux Networking\n*   Experience with Linux Kernel (highly desirable)\n*   Experience with Netfilter subsystem (good to have)\n\n#### Skill level\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#skill-level-5)\n\n*   Challenging\n\n#### Project size\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#project-size-5)\n\n*   Medium (175 hours) or Large (350 hours)\n\n#### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#mentors-4)\n\n*   [Lourival Vieira Neto](mailto:lourival.neto@gmail.com) and [Mohammad Shehar Yaar Tausif](mailto:sheharyaar48@gmail.com)\n\n* * *\n\n### Add support for prepared statements for LuaSQL\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#add-support-for-prepared-statements-for-luasql)\n\n['LuaSQL'](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasql) is a generic interface from Lua to a DBMS. It aims at portability over performance, but it allows extensions to suit the particularities of each DBMS.\n\nThe inclusion of support for prepared statements in LuaSQL has been discussed thoroughly some time ago, but since each DBMS offers very different APIs there is no standard that could be defined to assure portability between them. Anyway the demand persists.\n\nThis project proposes the addition of a minimal API that would allow each driver to offer prepared statements according to its DBMS restrictions and mechanisms.\n\n#### Expected results\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#expected-results-6)\n\n*   Propose a new API that would be flexibly enough to cover the main features of each database respecting each different mechanisms of defining prepared statements\n*   Implement the new API into one or more drivers\n*   Test and document everything\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#prerequisites-5)\n\n*   C programming languages\n*   Experience with any database C API (highly desirable)\n*   Experience with Lua-C API (highly desirable)\n*   Experience with Lua (good to have)\n\n#### Skill level\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#skill-level-6)\n\n*   Challenging\n\n#### Project size\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#project-size-6)\n\n*   Large (350 hours)\n\n#### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#mentors-5)\n\n*   [Tomás Guisasola](mailto:tomasguisasola@gmail.com)\n\n* * *\n\n### Lunatik Binding for Linux Traffic Control (TC) and eBPF Maps\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#lunatik-binding-for-linux-traffic-control-tc-and-ebpf-maps)\n\nThis project aims to create **Lunatik bindings for the Linux Traffic Control (TC) subsystem and eBPF maps** to enable efficient and programmable network traffic control. These bindings will allow **Lua scripts** to manipulate TC and interact with **eBPF maps**, providing a flexible interface for traffic shaping, filtering, and monitoring.\n\nThis work is **heavily inspired by** the [luaxdp](https://github.com/luainkernel/lunatik?tab=readme-ov-file#xdp) binding, which integrates Lua with **XDP (eXpress Data Path)** using eBPF. Given that **TC and XDP both utilize eBPF**, this new binding (_luatc_) will **reuse and adapt parts of the luaxdp codebase**, ensuring consistency and maintainability.\n\n[Linux Traffic Control (TC)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html) is a subsystem of the Linux kernel that allows administrators to **manage network packet transmission**, enabling features like **traffic shaping, queuing, scheduling, and policing**. It is widely used for **bandwidth control, Quality of Service (QoS), and network performance optimization**.\n\nConfiguring TC using traditional tools can be **complex and static**, making it difficult to implement **custom traffic processing logic**. **Lunatik**, a Lua-based kernel scripting interface, can simplify this process by allowing users to write **Lua scripts** that dynamically interact with **TC queuing disciplines (qdiscs), classes, and filters**.\n\nAdditionally, this project will introduce **support for eBPF maps** within Lunatik. [eBPF maps](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/maps.html) are a key component of eBPF, providing **efficient storage and retrieval of structured data between user space and kernel space**. This functionality will **not be restricted to the TC binding (_luatc_)**, but will be implemented **as a general feature in Lunatik**, enabling **other kernel extensions** to leverage eBPF maps.\n\n#### Expected results\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#expected-results-7)\n\n*   A fully functional **Lunatik binding for the TC subsystem**, allowing Lua scripts to configure and manipulate network traffic.\n*   **Support for eBPF maps in Lunatik**, enabling efficient **data sharing between Lua scripts and eBPF programs**.\n*   **Integration with the existing luaxdp codebase**, reusing and adapting components where possible.\n*   **Clear documentation and examples**, demonstrating how to use _luatc_ for **network traffic control** and **eBPF maps for data storage**.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#prerequisites-6)\n\n*   Lua and C programming languages\n*   Linux Networking\n*   Experience with Linux Kernel (highly desirable)\n*   Experience with Traffic Control (TC) subsystem (good to have)\n*   Experience with eBPF maps (good to have)\n\n#### Skill level\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#skill-level-7)\n\n*   Challenging\n\n#### Project size\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#project-size-7)\n\n*   Large (350 hours)\n\n#### Mentors\n\n[](https://github.com/labluapucrio/gsoc#mentors-6)\n\n*   [Lourival Vieira Neto](mailto:lourival.neto@gmail.com)\n\n* * *\n"}
