*\n\nGSoC project ideas[](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/gsoc.html#gsoc-project-ideas \"Link to this heading\")\n==========================================================================================================================\n\nThis page describes ideas you can use as a starting point for your project proposal. If you have not done so yet, you should **start by reading our [guide on how to apply](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/apply.html)** to a Zulip outreach program. As noted in the guide:\n\n> Your first priority during the contribution period should be figuring out how to become an effective Zulip contributor. Start developing your project proposal only once you have experience with iterating on your PRs to get them ready for integration. That way, you’ll have a much better idea of what you want to work on and how much you can accomplish.\n\nProject size[](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/gsoc.html#project-size \"Link to this heading\")\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have designed all our projects to have incremental milestones that can be completed throughout the program. Consequently, Zulip projects described below are generally compatible with both large-sized (350 hours) and medium-sized (175 hours) projects. Of course, the amount of progress you will be expected to make depends on whether you are doing a 175-hour or 350-hour project. Because it takes significant time investment to learn how to contribute complex features to Zulip’s codebase, we are not planning to offer small-size projects.\n\nContributors who master the art of consistently packaging their work into correct, [reviewable pull requests](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/reviewable-prs.html) are able to make major improvements to the Zulip app. If you pay attention to the contributor guidelines, carefully review your own work before asking anyone else for review, take the time to clearly communicate your changes, and apply the feedback you receive to your next contribution, you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish.\n\nFocus areas[](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/gsoc.html#focus-areas \"Link to this heading\")\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor 2025, we are particularly interested in GSoC contributors who have strong skills at full-stack feature development, Typescript, visual design, HTML/CSS, Flutter, or performance optimization. So if you’re an applicant with those skills and are looking for an organization to join, we’d love to talk to you!\n\nThe Zulip project has a huge surface area, so even when we’re focused on something, a large amount of essential work goes into other parts of the project. Every area of Zulip could benefit from the work of a contributor with strong programming skills, so don’t feel discouraged if the areas mentioned above are not your main strength.\n\nProject ideas by area[](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/gsoc.html#project-ideas-by-area \"Link to this heading\")\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section contains the seeds of project ideas; you will need to do research on the Zulip codebase, read issues on GitHub, read documentation, and talk with developers to put together a complete project proposal. It’s also fine to come up with your own project ideas. As you’ll see below, you can put together a great project around one of the [area labels](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels) on GitHub; each has a cluster of problems in one part of the Zulip project that we’d love to improve.\n\n### Full stack and web frontend focused projects[](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/gsoc.html#full-stack-and-web-frontend-focused-projects \"Link to this heading\")\n\nCode: [github.com/zulip/zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/) – Python, Django, TypeScript/JavaScript, and CSS.\n\n*   **Cluster of priority features**. Implement a cluster of new full stack features for Zulip. The [high priority label](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22priority%3A+high%22) documents hundreds of issues that we’ve identified as important to the project. A great project can be 3-5 significant features around a theme (often, but not necessarily, an [area label](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels)); the goal will be to implement and get fully merged a cluster of features with a meaningful impact on the project. Zulip has a lot of half-finished PRs, so some features might be completed by reading, understanding, rebasing, and reviving an existing pull request. 175 or 350 hours; difficulty will vary. **Skills required**: Depends on the features; Tim Abbott will help you select an appropriate cluster once we’ve gotten to know you and your strengths through your getting involved in the project.\n    \n    Experts: Tim Abbott and various others depending on project area\n    \n*   **Complete some unfinished projects**. This is a variant of the previous project idea category, but focused on projects with significant existing work to start from and polish, rather than projects that have not been seriously attempted previously.\n    \n    We maintain a [completion candidate label](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22completion+candidate%22) for pull requests where a previous contributor (sometimes via GSoC!) did significant work towards something valuable, and there’s significant feedback from maintainers, but the project was never finished, and requires significant further effort from a new contributor in order to progress. One of our goals for this summer’s GSoC is to complete many of these issues. Start by picking something that’s interesting to you, and you feel you have the skills required to complete. Read the code and the feedback, and then create your own PR for the issue. See the [guide on continuing unfinished work](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/continuing-unfinished-work.html) for details. 175 or 350 hours; difficulty will vary. **Skills required**: Varies with project; a common skill will be good reading comprehension and organization/communication skills, to walk maintainers through how you resolved problems, addressed any pending feedback on the previous PR, and your understanding of the outstanding questions for a given project. Taking the time to get really good at resolving merge conflicts is likely to be valuable here as well.\n    \n    Experts: Tim Abbott and various others depending on project area\n    \n\n*   Migrate Zulip’s **[direct message recipient data structures](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/25713)** to a new model that enables personal settings associated with a direct message conversation, and add several settings (see the linked issues) enabled by that infrastructure work. 175 or 350 hours; fairly difficult. **Skills required**: This project will be deep Python 3/PostgreSQL work. Concretely, challenging parts of this project include thinking about races and database transactions, writing database migrations intended to be run live at scale, complex internal refactors, and carefully verifying the indexes used by migrated database queries.\n    \n    Experts: Tim Abbott, Mateusz Mandera, Prakhar Pratyush\n    \n*   **Implement [channel groups](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/31972)** that simplify administration of collections of related channels in Zulip. Contributors interested in working on this should start with studying Zulip’s existing channel and group-based permissions system, both UX and implementation, and doing some starter issues in the settings area. 175 or 350 hours; medium difficulty. **Skills required**: Ability to read and understand a lot of code, as well web frontend work in TypeScript/HTML/CSS, with a bit of Python server programming. We’ll be particularly interested in the ability to explain and reason about complex logic and follow the existing UI patterns for group settings and channel settings.\n    \n    Experts: Sahil Batra, Shubham Padia\n    \n*   Add the core infrastructure for **topic-based permissions and settings** like [pinned topics](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/19483) and [read-only topics](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/26944), and then build some of those settings. This project will be a mixture of Python 3/PostgreSQL work, including thinking about database transactions and races, writing database migrations intended to be run live at scale, and complex logic to handle moving messages correctly in the context of these settings, including significant changes to the Zulip API and API documentation. 175 or 350 hours; fairly difficult. **Skills required**: A high level of fluency with writing readable Python 3 and thinking about corner cases.\n    \n    Experts: Tim Abbott, Prakhar Pratyush\n    \n*   Zulip’s [**REST API documentation**](https://zulip.com/api/), which is an important resource for any organization integrating with Zulip, as well as the developers of our API clients. Zulip has a [nice framework](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/api.html) for writing API documentation built by past GSoC students based on the OpenAPI standard with built-in automated tests of the data both the Python and curl examples. However, the documentation isn’t yet what we’re hoping for: there are a few dozen endpoints that are missing, several of which are quite important, the visual design isn’t perfect (especially for, e.g., `GET /events`), many templates could be deleted with a bit of framework effort, etc. See the [API docs area label](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22area%3A+documentation+%28api+and+integrations%29%22) for some specific projects in the area; and `git grep pending_endpoints` to find the list of endpoints that need documentation and their priorities. Our goal for the summer is for 1-2 students to resolve all open issues related to the REST API documentation. 175 or 350 hours; difficulty easy or medium. **Skills required**: Python programming. Expertise with reading documentation and English writing are valuable, and product thinking about the experience of using third-party APIs is very helpful.\n    \n    Expert: Lauryn Menard\n    \n\n*   **Improve the UI and visual design** of the Zulip web app. We are working on a major redesign for the core surfaces of the Zulip web app – see the [redesign label](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aredesign) for specced out work, with more to come. We’re particularly excited about students who are interested in making our CSS clean and readable as part of working on the UI. 175 or 350 hours; medium to difficult. **Skills required**: Design, HTML and CSS skills; most important is the ability to carefully verify that one’s changes are correct and will not break other parts of the app; design changes are very rewarding since they are highly user-facing, but that also means there is a higher bar for correctness and reviewability for one’s work. A great application would include PRs making small, clean improvements to the Zulip UI (whether logged-in or logged-out pages).\n    \n    Experts: Aman Agrawal, Karl Stolley, Alya Abbott\n    \n\n*   **Improve type safety of node tests**. Rework Zulip’s [automated node tests](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing/testing-with-node.html) to use objects that consistently have the correct type. Currently, many tests use fake message, user, or channel objects with only a handful of fields relevant to the test. We’ve been working towards `web/tests/lib/example_*`. A good starter project would be to try to convert a small test module that currently does not use the `make_user` type functions to do so. The [main TypeScript migration thread](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/6-frontend/topic/typescript.20migration/with/2085240) is useful background reading, and [#frontend](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/6-frontend) channel is a good place to start new topics while working on this project. 175 or 350 hours; medium difficulty. **Skills required**: TypeScript fluency, and the discipline to write easily reviewed pull requests that often will include a series of changes to clean up an individual test while you’re working on it.\n    \n    Experts: Afeefuddin, Lalit\n    \n*   **Replace hundreds of `dict[str, Any]` types with modern dataclasses**. While functionally efficient, `dataclasses` are more readable, safe against typos, and have nice support for optimizing them further using `__slots__`. A lot of Zulip server code was written before dataclasses existed, and while a lot has been converted naturally as part of other projects, we’d like to make a focused push to replace the remaining ones. This project will involve making dozens of small commits and PRs, each a clean refactor converting a single type. Use [this conversation](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/3-backend/topic/migrating.20to.20dataclasses/near/2085283) for discussion and coordination. **Skills required**. Solid understanding of statically typed Python, and the discipline to learn to write refactoring commits that are easy to integrate, following our standard guidelines, because they convincingly don’t change any product behavior while improving type-safety.\n    \n    Experts: Tim Abbott, Anders Kaseorg\n    \n*   **Optimize performance and scalability**, either for the web frontend or the server. Zulip is already one of the faster web apps out there, but we have a number of ideas for how to make it substantially faster yet. This is likely a particularly challenging project to do well, since there are a lot of subtle interactions to understand. 175 or 350 hours; difficult. **Skill recommended**: Strong debugging, communication, and code reading skills are most important here. JavaScript experience; some Python/Django experience, some skill with CSS, ideally experience using the Chrome Performance profiling tools (but you can pick this up as you go) can be useful depending on what profiling shows. Our [backend scalability design doc](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/performance.html) and the [performance label](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/area%3A%20performance) may be helpful reading for the backend part of this.\n    \n    Experts: Tim Abbott\n    \n\n*   Fill in gaps, fix bugs, and improve the framework for Zulip’s **library of native integrations**. We have about 120 native integrations, but there are a number of others we would like to add. Also, several extensions to the framework that would dramatically improve the user experience of using integrations, e.g., being able to do callbacks to third-party services like Stripe to display more user-friendly notifications. The [the integrations label on GitHub](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/area%3A%20integrations) lists some of the priorities here (many of which are great preparatory projects). 175 or 350 hours; medium difficulty with various possible difficult extensions. **Skills required**: Strong Python experience, will to install and do careful manual testing of third-party products. Fluent English, usability sense and/or technical writing skills are all pluses.\n    \n    Experts: Niloth, Lauryn Menard\n    \n*   **Make Zulip integrations easier for nontechnical users to set up**. This includes adding a backend permissions system for managing bot permissions (and implementing the enforcement logic), adding an OAuth system for presenting those controls to users, as well as making the `/integrations` page UI have buttons to create a bot, rather than sending users to the administration page. 175 or 350 hours; easy to difficult depending on scope. **Skills recommended**: Strong Python/Django; JavaScript, CSS, and design sense helpful. Understanding of implementing OAuth providers, e.g., having built a prototype with [the Django OAuth toolkit](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) would be great to demonstrate as part of an application. The [Zulip integration writing guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/integrations.html) and [integration documentation](https://zulip.com/integrations/) are useful materials for learning about how things currently work, and [the integrations label on GitHub](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/area%3A%20integrations) has a bunch of good starter issues to demonstrate your skills if you’re interested in this area.\n    \n    Experts: Niloth, Lauryn Menard\n    \n*   Work on Zulip’s **development and testing infrastructure**. Zulip is a project that takes great pride in building great tools for development, but there’s always more to do to make the experience delightful. Significantly, about 10% of Zulip’s open issues are ideas for how to improve the project’s contributor experience, and are [in](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/area%3A%20tooling) [these](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/area%3A%20testing-coverage) [four](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/area%3A%20testing-infrastructure) [labels](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/area%3A%20provision) for tooling improvements.\n    \n    This is a somewhat unusual project, in that it would likely consist of dozens of small improvements to the overall codebase, but this sort of work has a huge impact on the experience of other Zulip developers and thus the community as a whole (project leader Tim Abbott spends more time on the development experience than any other single area). 175 or 350 hours; difficult. **Skills required**: Python, some DevOps, and a passion for checking your work carefully. A strong applicant for this will have completed several projects in these areas.\n    \n    Expert: Tim Abbott\n    \n\n### Terminal app[](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/gsoc.html#terminal-app \"Link to this heading\")\n\nCode: [Zulip Terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal)\n\nExperts: Neil Pilgrim, Aman Agrawal\n\n*   Work on Zulip Terminal, the official terminal client for Zulip. zulip-terminal is out in beta, but there’s still a lot to do for it to approach parity with the web app. We would be happy to accept multiple strong students to work on this project. 175 or 350 hours; medium difficulty. **Skills required**: Python 3 development skills, good communication and project management skills, good at reading code and testing.\n    \n\n### Desktop app[](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/gsoc.html#desktop-app \"Link to this heading\")\n\nCode: [Our cross-platform desktop app written in JavaScript on Electron](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-desktop).\n\nExpert: Anders Kaseorg\n\n*   **Contribute to our [Electron-based desktop client application](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-desktop)**. There’s plenty of feature/UI work to do, but focus areas for us include things to (1) improve the release process for the app, using automated testing, TypeScript, etc., and (2) polishing the UI. Browse the open issues and get involved! 175 or 350 hours. This is a difficult project because it is important user-facing code without good automated testing, so the bar for writing high quality, reviewable PRs that convince others your work is correct is high. **Skills required**: JavaScript, Electron; you can learn Electron as part of your application.\n    \n*   **Prototype a next generation Zulip desktop app implemented using the Tauri Rust-based framework**. Tauri is a promising new project that we believe is likely a better technical direction for client applications than Electron for desktop apps, for security and resource consumption reasons. The goal of this project would be to build a working prototype to evaluate to what extent Tauri is a viable platform for us to migrate the Zulip desktop app to. 350 hours only; difficult. **Skills required**: Ability to learn quickly. Experience with Rust and secure software design may be helpful.\n    \n\n### Mobile app[](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/gsoc.html#mobile-app \"Link to this heading\")\n\nCode: [The next-generation Zulip mobile app, written with Flutter](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter) (now in beta)\n\nExperts: Greg Price, Chris Bobbe, Zixuan James Li\n\n*   Work on the **upcoming Flutter-based Zulip client**. Zulip has a freshly-written [new mobile app built on Flutter](https://blog.zulip.com/2024/12/12/new-flutter-mobile-app-beta/), which we’re nearing the point of rolling out to replace the legacy React Native-based app. We’ll be using this foundation to build much-anticipated features that the Zulip mobile apps have never had before, as well as some that the legacy app had but were skipped for the initial rollout.\n    \n    This project will involve building features for the Flutter app, including code for UI, data structures, and interacting with the Zulip server and the Android and/or iOS platforms. For a sense of the features we’re working on, see our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/zulip/projects/5/views/4) for the new app; the tasks we’ll be working on during GSoC will come mostly from the \\[“M6: Post-launch” milestone\\]\\[flutter-milestone-post-launch\\]. For some features, we [may find](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/2-general/topic/Flutter/near/1524757) ourselves [contributing changes](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/129802) upstream to the Flutter project itself. 175 or 350 hours; difficult.\n    \n    **Skills required**: Ability to learn quickly, check your work carefully, and communicate clearly and accurately. The code for this project will be written primarily in Dart atop Flutter; previous experience may be helpful, but you can learn both during the contributions leading up to your application. Previous experience with Android or iOS may also be helpful but is not necessary.\n    \n\n[Previous](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/experience.html \"How to have an amazing experience\") [Next](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/mentoring.html \"Mentoring\")\n\n* * *\n\n© Copyright 2012–2015 Dropbox, Inc., 2015–2021 Kandra Labs, Inc., and contributors.\n\nBuilt with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) using a [theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) provided by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).\n"}
