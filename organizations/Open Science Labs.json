As an umbrella organization, OSL hosts links to the ideas pages of each member organization. You can explore these projects here.\n\nAt OSL, we've assembled a selection of project ideas that not only embody our mission but also provide enriching experiences for student and newcomers open-source developpers. These projects cover a variety of topics and technologies, catering to diverse interests. Below, we've outlined some potential project ideas we're considering for GSoC. We believe these projects provide students with a valuable chance to engage with open-source efforts and develop their skills under the mentorship of seasoned professionals.\n\nThis page details the sub-organizations available for GSoC 2025 participants. Applicants are welcome to reach out to us on our [Discord](https://opensciencelabs.org/discord) or directly contact the sub-oganization/project mentors.\n\nSub-Organizations [#](https://opensciencelabs.org/opportunities/gsoc/project-ideas/#sub-organizations \"Permanent link\")\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Note: Each organization includes a designated list of mentors. Please get in touch with them directly if you have any inquiries._\n\n### ArxLang/ASTx [#](https://opensciencelabs.org/opportunities/gsoc/project-ideas/#arxlangastx \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Description**: ASTx is an agnostic expression structure for AST. It is agnostic because it is not specific to any language.\n*   **Project WEB Page**: [https://astx.arxlang.org/](https://astx.arxlang.org/)\n*   **Project Ideas**: [link](https://github.com/arxlang/astx/wiki/Project-Ideas)\n\n### Makim [#](https://opensciencelabs.org/opportunities/gsoc/project-ideas/#makim \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Description**: Makim is based on **make** and focus on improving the way to define targets and dependencies. Instead of using the Makefile format, it uses yaml format.\n*   **Project WEB Page**: [https://osl-incubator.github.io/makim/](https://osl-incubator.github.io/makim/)\n*   **Project Ideas**: [link](https://github.com/osl-incubator/makim/wiki/Project-Ideas)\n\n### PyDataStructs [#](https://opensciencelabs.org/opportunities/gsoc/project-ideas/#pydatastructs \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Description**: PyDataStructs project aims to be a Python package for various data structures and algorithms (including their parallel implementations).\n*   **Project WEB Page**: [https://pydatastructs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://pydatastructs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n*   **Project Ideas**: [link](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-Project-Ideas)\n\n### Rago [#](https://opensciencelabs.org/opportunities/gsoc/project-ideas/#rago \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Description**: Rago is a lightweight framework for RAG.\n*   **Project WEB Page**: [https://osl-incubator.github.io/rago/](https://osl-incubator.github.io/rago/)\n*   **Project Ideas**: [link](https://github.com/osl-incubator/rago/wiki/Project-Ideas)\n\n### Sugar [#](https://opensciencelabs.org/opportunities/gsoc/project-ideas/#sugar \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Description**: Sugar organizes your stack of containers, gathering some useful scripts and keeping this information centralized in a configuration file with a friendly command line interface.\n*   **Project WEB Page**: [https://osl-incubator.github.io/sugar/](https://osl-incubator.github.io/sugar/)\n*   **Project Ideas**: [link](https://github.com/osl-incubator/sugar/wiki/Project-Ideas)\n"}
