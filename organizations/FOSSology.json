This will include comments, function documentation, and metadata extracted using Nirjas, ensuring consistency, clarity, and quality in technical documentation.\n\nWe have previously worked on extracting metadata and comments using regex-based approaches in Nirjas. While this method provided structured results, it can also be used to generate high-quality documentation. Leveraging LLMs with metadata extraction from Nirjas.\n\n**What we want to achieve?**\n\n1.  Integrate LLMs for Documentation Generation\n2.  Use Existing Knowledge Sources for Training\n3.  Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Approach\n4.

Moreover, existing scheduler design is not touched in years.\n\n**Concerning points**\n\n1.  The scheduler is written in C which makes it next to impossible to find cause of a failure.\n2.  The C language does not support exception handling out of the box. It makes code less readable and prone to errors.\n3.  The linear queue design causes issue when there should be only one instance of an agent running for an upload, but overall the agent is not mutually exclusive.\n    \n    > For example, if the monkbulk has a limit set to 1, it should be implied for only single upload. But with linear queue, this monkbulk job will block all other agents from executing even when they are not effected by the results of monkbulk.\n    > \n    > This essentially makes the agent mutually exclusive even though, there is a special flag EXCLUSIVE for the very same purpose: [https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Job-Scheduler#agentconfs](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Job-Scheduler#agentconfs)\n    \n\n*   One idea on redesigning the queue, it can be broken into buckets per upload each maintaining its own priority queue. There can be another queue for global operations like maintenance, delagent, etc.\n*   Doing so, each bucket can be traversed in round-robin and pick first pending job and check against host limit. This will eliminate the scenario mentioned in point 3. Also, exclusive agents can be sent to global queue.\n    \n    ```\n      upload specific queue|-<upload_2> -> nomos, copyright, ojo, keyword|-<upload_3> -> monkbulk, decider, monkbulk, decider|-<upload_4> -> reuser, deciderglobal queue-> delagent,\n    ```\n    \n\n4.  Since the FOSSology is released, there can be number of new scheduling libraries being released which needs to be explored. They can be a nice addition to the project.\n5.  There have been some work already done in GSoC 2024, Can be visited [here](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2024/scheduler/)\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\- |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\*\\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\* |\n| Project size | Large |\n| Preferred contributor | Professional |\n| Skills needed | Go |\n| Contact | @GMishx @Kaushl2208 @avinal @shaheemazmalmmd |\n\n### Debian packaging for Debian repository[​](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2025/GSoC-projects#debian-packaging-for-debian-repository \"Direct link to Debian packaging for Debian repository\")\n\n**Goal:** Improve Debian packaging and make it acceptable for APT\n\nThe existing effort to put FOSSology under Debian packaging list needs to be taken forward. A repository under Debian Salsa was setup initially but not maintained any more: [https://salsa.debian.org/fossology-team/fossology](https://salsa.debian.org/fossology-team/fossology) It is configured to use [gbp](https://honk.sigxcpu.org/piki/projects/git-buildpackage/).\n\n**Blockers**\n\n1.  The Debian building mechanism does not allow installation from sources other than apt. The Composer packages need to be packed as Debian packages and shipped with FOSSology.\n2.  Packaging and shipping other tools needs to satisfy their licensing terms.\n3.  The versions of packages in APT and actual versions used are different.\n4.  APT also provides JS libraries like JQuery and DataTables but RHL does not.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   [https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2075](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2075)\n*   [https://wiki.debian.org/PackagingWithGit](https://wiki.debian.org/PackagingWithGit)\n*   [https://wiki.debian.org/SimplePackagingTutorial](https://wiki.debian.org/SimplePackagingTutorial)\n*   [https://wiki.debian.org/Diagrams](https://wiki.debian.org/Diagrams)\n*   [https://wiki.debian.org/PHP](https://wiki.debian.org/PHP)\n*   [https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/0fb2dbc4-f43d-477e-8b14-20c426f970de](https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/0fb2dbc4-f43d-477e-8b14-20c426f970de)\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\*\\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Project size | Small |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/Professional |\n| Skills needed | Debian, APT, CMake |\n| Contact | @GMishx @shaheemazmalmmd @Kaushl2208 |\n\n### User & Developer Assistant Chatbot using Large Language Models[​](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2025/GSoC-projects#user--developer-assistant-chatbot-using-large-language-models \"Direct link to User & Developer Assistant Chatbot using Large Language Models\")\n\n**Goal:** To develop an intelligent assistant chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide comprehensive support for both end-users and developers of our tool. The assistant will bridge the gap between users, documentation, and the codebase to ensure an interactive and efficient problem-solving experience.\n\nThe chatbot will be designed to interactively assist new and existing users with various aspects of the tool, including:\n\n1.  Feature Discovery:\n    \n    *   Answer questions about available features, their functionalities, and usage.\n    *   Provide contextual information derived from the tool's wiki and feature documentation.\n2.  Problem Resolution and Recommendations:\n    \n    *   Assist users during the project setup phase by identifying common setup errors.\n    *   Provide troubleshooting steps for known issues by integrating knowledge from GitHub issues.\n3.  Developer Support:\n    \n    *   Answer codebase-related queries by identifying relevant classes, methods, or functions.\n    *   Enhance developers' understanding of the project by linking features to the corresponding implementation in the code.\n\nThe chatbot will utilize **LangChain**, **RAG**, and a **Vector Database** for retrieval, enabling contextual conversations. A seamless pipeline will integrate multiple data sources, including documentation, GitHub issues, and the codebase.\n\n**What We Want to Achieve:**\n\n1.  **For End-Users**:\n    \n    *   **Improved Onboarding**:\n        *   Enable new users to quickly understand the tool's features and capabilities through interactive conversations.\n    *   **Efficient Problem Resolution**:\n        *   Provide real-time recommendations for known issues encountered during project setup.\n        *   Reduce reliance on manual troubleshooting by surfacing relevant GitHub issues.\n    *   **Enhanced User Engagement**:\n        *   Increase user satisfaction by offering a conversational interface that adapts to their queries and knowledge level.\n2.  **For Developers**:\n    \n    *   **Codebase Exploration**:\n        *   Allow developers to query the codebase for insights into specific classes or functions, fostering faster understanding and debugging.\n    *   **Knowledge Consolidation**:\n        *   Create a unified interface where feature descriptions, documentation, and implementation details converge.\n3.  **Broader Objectives**:\n    \n    *   Reduce the time spent on documentation searches.\n\nPS: _There are some features which aligns with the goal but not be possible in short time interval. Topics like: Knowledge Consolidation & Codebase Exploration but the development should be done by taking all this in mind_\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\* |\n| Project size | Large |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/professional |\n| Skills needed | Python, LLMs, Documentation Standards |\n| Contact | @Kaushl2208 @GMishx @shaheemazmalmmd |\n\n### Support text phrases and bulk based scanning for MONK a like agent[​](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2025/GSoC-projects#support-text-phrases-and-bulk-based-scanning-for-monk-a-like-agent \"Direct link to Support text phrases and bulk based scanning for MONK a like agent\")\n\n**Goal:** Adding text phrases from UI to database and use existing bulk phrases and provide ability to scan them using MONK and identify files if the match is 100%\n\nFLOW :\n\n*   Create a UI Where user can add multiple text phrases associated with license(FROM FOSSology License Database).\n*   Use existing bulk phrases table from database.\n*   Create a new agent like existing MONK agent which not only identifies the matches but also decides the files.\n*   Test cases needs to be provided as well.\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\*\\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\* |\n| Project size | Medium |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/professional |\n| Skills needed | PHP, C++ |\n| Contact | @GMishx @shaheemazmalmmd |\n\n### Enhance atarashi ability[​](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2025/GSoC-projects#enhance-atarashi-ability \"Direct link to Enhance atarashi ability\")\n\n**Goal:** Improve license identification of atarashi\n\n*   Improve existing model which have 80 % accuracy.\n*   Use some model to identify the license-possibility using keywords.\n*   Once there is some license possibility pass this to existing trained model to identify the accurate license.\n*   If the trained model miss to find the license then add license-possibility to file so that users checks the file and clarify.\n*   Work on the existing branch([https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/1634](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/1634)) and make sure that this gets merged.\n*   Know more about [atarashi](https://fossology.github.io/atarashi/).\n\n| Category | Rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Hanging Fruit | \\* |\n| Risk/Exploratory | \\*\\* |\n| Fun/Peripheral | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Core Development | \\* |\n| Project Infrastructure | \\*\\*\\* |\n| Project size | Small |\n| Preferred contributor | Student/Professional |\n| Skills needed | Python, ML , CMake |\n| Contact | @GMishx @shaheemazmalmmd @Kaushl2208 @hastagAB |\n\n### Integrating Open Source Review Toolkit[​](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2025/GSoC-projects#integrating-open-source-review-toolkit \"Direct link to Integrating Open Source Review Toolkit\")\n\n**Goal:** Using ORT to fetch dependencies and generate SBOM\n\nBuild systems fetch the required dependencies (library/artifact) for a project while building the project.

Go through the changes in the codebase and devise strategies for integrating them\n2.  Inspect the changes in #2086 and complete the work\n3.  By the end, we should have a fully working FOSSology installation on Kubernetes\n4.  Create documentation for setting up FOSSology on a cluster and all the options available\n5.  Stretch goal: Create an all-in-one script for easy Kubernetes setup with FOSSology\n6.  Stretch goal: Add mechanism for health checks of the installation\n7.  Stretch goal: Expose usage and performance metrics\n\n#### References[​](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2025/GSoC-projects#references \"Direct link to References\")\n\n*   #2086\n*   #2075\n*
