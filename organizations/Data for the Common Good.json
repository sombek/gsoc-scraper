The application serves as a data interoperability layer, allowing users to seamlessly transfer their healthcare data to meet various needs, such as research participation, second opinions, or personal health tracking.\nExpected Outcomes\tOne or both of the following: Improving the integration with diverse FHIR servers and refining data transformation capabilities. Building APIs or plugins to support additional healthcare applications and third-party services.\nSkills\tJava, python\nMentors\tTBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team.\nProject Size\t350 hours\nRating\tmedium\nProject 2\nTitle\tEnhancing the SMART on FHIR Frontend for Patient-Controlled Data Sharing\nDescription\tThis project aims to improve the frontend user interface for a SMART on FHIR application that enables patients to autonomously access, manage, and share their electronic health records (EHR). The focus is on making the UI more intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience for users connecting to the backend service.\nExpected Outcomes\tImproved User Experience (UX)\nSkills\tJavascript, Node\nMentors\tTBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team.\nProject Size\t350 hours\nRating\tmedium\nProject 3\nTitle\tDeveloping a FHIR Resource Tabular Viewer for Efficient Data Exploration\nDescription\tThis project aims to build a FHIR Resource Tabular Viewer, an application that transforms complex, nested FHIR data structures into an easy-to-navigate tabular format. This tool will allow users—such as researchers, clinicians, and developers—to efficiently search, filter, and analyze FHIR resources, improving accessibility and usability of healthcare data.\nExpected Outcomes\tTabular Representation of FHIR Data and Search & Filtering Capabilities.\nSkills\tPython, Javascript\nMentors\tTBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team.\nProject Size\t350 hours\nRating\tmedium\nProject 4\nTitle\tDeveloping Custom Jupyter Notebooks for AVRO File Processing and QA/QC Analysis\nDescription\tThis project aims to create custom Jupyter notebooks that help users efficiently unpack AVRO files, perform quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) checks, and run basic data analyses. The goal is to provide a user-friendly, interactive environment where users can explore, validate, and analyze AVRO-formatted data without requiring deep expertise in data engineering.\nExpected Outcomes\tAVRO File Handling on startup, QA/QC Checks, Basic Data Analysis.\nSkills\tPython, networking\nMentors\tTBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team.\nProject Size\t350 hours\nRating\tmedium\nProject 5\nTitle\tExtending the HAPI FHIR Server for Enhanced Functionality and Interoperability\nDescription\tThis project aims to extend the HAPI FHIR Server, a leading open-source implementation of the FHIR standard, to improve its functionality, scalability, and interoperability. The enhancements will support advanced healthcare use cases, making it easier for developers and organizations to manage and exchange FHIR-compliant health data efficiently.\nExpected Outcomes\tCustom FHIR Operations & Extensions\nSkills\tJava, FHIR\nMentors\tTBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team.\nProject Size\t350 hours\nRating\tmedium\nProject 6\nTitle\tDeveloping a Translation Service to Connect GEARBOx API with mCODE Trial Matching Service\nDescription\tThis project aims to build a translation service that connects the GEARBOx API with the mCODE (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) trial matching service. The goal is to enable seamless translation of oncology data between GEARBOx and mCODE, allowing healthcare providers, researchers, and clinical trial platforms to effectively match patients to relevant clinical trials based on their mCODE-compliant health data.\nExpected Outcomes\tData Mapping & Transformation, Interoperability & Validation\nSkills\tPython, Typescript\nMentors\tTBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team.\nProject Size\t350 hours\nRating\tmedium\nProject 7\nTitle\tBuilding a Chatbot for Generating GraphQL and Custom Queries for Cohort Descriptions\nDescription\tThis project aims to develop a chatbot powered by ChatGPT or another large language model (LLM) that allows users to describe a cohort of patients and automatically generates GraphQL queries or custom queries based on the input for the PCDC. The goal is to simplify the process of building complex queries for patient data by allowing users to interact with the chatbot in natural language, rather than navigating through a UI or manually searching for filters.\nExpected Outcomes\tGraphQL Query Generation\nSkills\tLLM, Javascript\nMentors\tTBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team.\nProject Size\t350 hours\nRating\thard\nProject 8\nTitle\tDeveloping a Cross-Platform App for User Consent and Data Sharing from Apple Health and CommonHealth Using React Native\nDescription\tThis project focuses on creating a cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android) using React Native that allows users to consent and share their health data from both Apple Health and CommonHealth. The app will enable users to manage their data sharing preferences, securely transmit health information, and empower them to participate in research or share data with healthcare providers.\nExpected Outcomes\tInitial App version\nSkills\tReact Native, Android, iOS\nMentors\tTBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team.\nProject Size\t350 hours\nRating\thard\n"}
