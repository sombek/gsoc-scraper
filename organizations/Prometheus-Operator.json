In addition to responding to your mentee on time, you will be required to submit evaluations on time. Failures to meet the deadlines might affect Prometheus-Operator's future participation in GSoC.\n\n**While we submit 2 topics this year, you can notice that both have the same mentors. Because we consider that it isn't sustainable and respectful for the 3 mentors to follow 2 projects in parallel, we intend to select only one project in the end. The selection will be based on the quality of the answers received.**\n\n* * *\n\nTemplate\n--------\n\n[](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/community/blob/main/mentoring/gsoc/2025/project_ideas.md#template)\n\n```\n### Project Title\n\n- Description:\n- Expected Outcome:\n- Recommended Skills:\n- Expected project size: # one of small (~90 hour projects), medium (~175 hour projects) and large (~350 hour projects)\n- Mentor(s): #For GSoC, it is **required** to have at least 2 mentors with 1 being a primary mentor.\n  - Jane Doe (@jane-github, jane@email.address) - primary\n  - John Doe (@john-github, john@email.address)\n- Upstream Issue (URL):\n```\n\n* * *\n\nIdeas\n-----\n\n[](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/community/blob/main/mentoring/gsoc/2025/project_ideas.md#ideas)\n\n### Status for configuration objects\n\n[](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/community/blob/main/mentoring/gsoc/2025/project_ideas.md#status-for-configuration-objects)\n\n*   Description: A frequent pain point for users is to understand whether their configuration resources are applied and if it's not the case, what's the issue. We improved a bit the situation by emitting events when the reconciliation loop rejects configuration resources but it would be even better if the information was persisted in the status subresource (for instance comparing the resource's generation against the observed generation can indicate if the latest version is reconciled or not).\n    \n    While workload resources like `Prometheus` and `Alertmanager` have gained a Status subresource, there's no such thing (yet) for configuration resources like `ServiceMonitor`, PodMonitor, `AlertmanagerConfig`, `Probe`, `ScrapeConfig` and `PrometheusRule`. The main difference between workload and configuration resources is that configuration resources can be selected by multiple workloads: for example, 2 different `Prometheus` resources can select the same `ServiceMonitor` resource. As a consequence, we can't use the same API already defined for workload resources. Please note that we don't want to forbid this situation since it is a perfectly valid and supported use case (for instance running 2 stacks in parallel during migrations).\n    \n*   Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes\n    \n*   Expected project size: large\n    \n*   Mentors:\n    \n    *   Jayapriya Pai (@slashpai, [slashpai9@gmail.com](mailto:slashpai9@gmail.com))\n    *   Simon Pasquier (@simonpasquier, [pasquier.simon@gmail.com](mailto:pasquier.simon@gmail.com))\n    *   M Vishwanath Sai (@mviswanathsai, [mviswanath.sai.met21@itbhu.ac.in](mailto:mviswanath.sai.met21@itbhu.ac.in))\n*   Upstream Issue (URL): [prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator#3335](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/3335)\n    \n\n### Daemonset mode for the Prometheus Agent\n\n[](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/community/blob/main/mentoring/gsoc/2025/project_ideas.md#daemonset-mode-for-the-prometheus-agent)\n\n*   Description: During the [last GSoC](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/community/blob/main/mentoring/gsoc/2024/project_ideas.md), Prometheus Operator gained the option to deploy a `PrometheusAgent` custom resource as a DaemonSet (instead of the default StatefulSet mode). The project was a success and met its objectives but the feature is still behind a feature flag because not all the functionalities have been implemented. The expectations for this year are to identify the remaining gaps, write a plan of action, implement the missing features and write documentation (tutorials for instance).\n*   Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes\n*   Expected project size: medium\n*   Mentor(s):\n    *   Jayapriya Pai (@slashpai, [slashpai9@gmail.com](mailto:slashpai9@gmail.com))\n    *   Simon Pasquier (@simonpasquier, [pasquier.simon@gmail.com](mailto:pasquier.simon@gmail.com))\n    *   M Vishwanath Sai (@mviswanathsai, [mviswanath.sai.met21@itbhu.ac.in](mailto:mviswanath.sai.met21@itbhu.ac.in))\n*   Upstream Issue (URL): [prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator#5495](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/5495)\n"}
