We’re a young community working towards enabling developers, researchers, and fellow students to build, compare and share state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.\n\nWe have participated in the past nine installments of Google Summer of Code, over the course of which our students built several excellent tools and features. If you are interested in participating as a student or mentor, scroll down to check out our projects and get involved! We are more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding CloudCV, so feel free to reach out to us on our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cloudcv-community/shared_invite/zt-1rkm0m8pw-TBkjRjx~_GyIvMVlF5iDHg) workspace or on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudcv).\n\n* * *\n\nEnhanced Test Suite and Improved User Experience\n------------------------------------------------\n\n#### SQL Django AngularJS AWS\n\nThis project is focused on significantly improving EvalAI’s usability by enhancing exsiting comprehensive test suite alongside a series of user experience enhancements. By increasing our test coverage, automating critical workflows, and refining the platform’s interface and documentation, this initiative aims to create a more robust, user-friendly, and resilient environment for both challenge hosts and participants.\n\nThe enhanced test suite will ensure that all core functionalities, from challenge creation to submission processing are verified, reducing bugs and increasing system reliability. In parallel, targeted user experience improvements will simplify navigation, enhance error reporting, and streamline user interactions, leading to a more intuitive and supportive EvalAI ecosystem.\n\n**Project Size**: Medium (175 hours)\n\n**Difficulty Rating**: Medium\n\nPlease wait for loading the projects ...\n\n![Image 1](https://gsoc.cloudcv.org/img/projects/user-experience-leaderboard-integrations.png)\n\n* * *\n\nMitigating Biases & Prompt Effects in Vision-Language Models\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Python PyTorch/TensorFlow NLP Vision-Language Models LLMs Bias and Fairness in AI\n\nThis research project aims to investigate how prompt engineering influences the behaviour and outputs of Vision-Language Models (VLLMs), with a particular focus on the emergence and amplification of biases. By systematically studying the relationship between prompt formulations and model responses, the project seeks to uncover the mechanisms through which biases are introduced and propose effective mitigation strategies.\n\n**Project Size**: Medium (175 hours)\n\n**Difficulty Rating**: Medium to Advanced\n\nPlease wait for loading the projects ...\n\n![Image 2](https://gsoc.cloudcv.org/img/projects/user-experience-leaderboard-integrations.png)\n\n* * *\n\nRAG-Based Chat Bot for Enhanced Challenge Support\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Python Natural Language Processing (NLP) Machine Learning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Django SQL\n\nThis project aims to enhance the user experience for both challenge hosts and participants by developing an intelligent, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) based chatbot. The chatbot will efficiently address queries related to challenge hosting, guidelines, troubleshooting, and FAQs. By integrating state-of-the-art NLP techniques with robust retrieval mechanisms, the solution will ensure prompt, accurate, and context-aware responses that reduce support overhead and streamline communication.\n\nUsing the RAG approach, the chatbot will retrieve relevant information from challenge documentation and combine it with generative models to create coherent and helpful answers. This will empower hosts to manage challenges more effectively and assist participants in resolving queries, ultimately contributing to a smoother and more interactive challenge experience.\n\n**Project Size**: Medium (175 hours)\n\n**Difficulty Rating**: Medium\n\nPlease wait for loading the projects ...\n\n![Image 3](https://gsoc.cloudcv.org/img/projects/user-experience-leaderboard-integrations.png)\n\nBecome a Mentor!\n----------------\n\nMentoring is very important to the future of CloudCV. It introduces new people to the world of open source software who will enrich our community with their ideas and talents.\n\nApart from technical skills, being a mentor requires your time, a clear roadmap for your project and good organization skills.
