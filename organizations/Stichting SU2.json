2011\nLocation: Netherlands\nPosts: 724\nRep Power: 21\n\t\nDear SU2 friends,\nThe SU2 Foundation is applying for Google Summer of Code 2025! From all the possible projects, we have made a selection of the topics that could be used in a GSoC project.\nThe document can be viewed here:\n\n\nGSOC 2025 ideas list\n\n\nFor more information on Google Summer of code, please see here:\nhttps://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\n\n\nPlease also read our other announcement on How to Apply:\nGSoC 2025 : How to apply\nLast edited by bigfootedrockmidget; February 16, 2025 at 19:34.\n\n  \t\n\n\n   February 7, 2025, 17:51\t\n\t  #2\n\nbigfootedrockmidget\nSenior Member\n \n\nbigfoot\nJoin Date: Dec 2011\nLocation: Netherlands\nPosts: 724\nRep Power: 21\n\t\nFor completeness, the complete project description has been copied below. Note that the most up to date description can be found in the link to the document above\n\n\nProject 1: Adding pressure-based solver\n\n\nProject Description (max. 5 Sentences)\nThe pressure-based solver has been requested for a long time. This solver is an important addition to the CFD solvers, especially for low Mach and incompressible flows. People have worked on it (detailed documentation available), and there is a branch that contains a working version, but this was never finalized and added to the main SU2 branch. Hence, the project's objective is to evaluate the current status of attempts, and propose a strategy for getting the pressure-based solver in the latest version of SU2.\nExpected Outcome (deliverables): Finalize pressure-based solver, validate with test cases, tutorial and merge the PR.\nSkills Required: C++, experience with CFD and numerical methods\nPossible Mentors: Nitish Anand and Edwin van der Weide\nExpected Project Size: 175 hrs/medium\nDifficulty rating: medium-hard (needs experience with Computational Fluid Dynamics)\n\n\nProject 2: Using data-driven, physics-informed machine learning to model fluid properties in computational fluid dynamics.\n\n\nProject Description (max. 5 Sentences)\nThe properties of complex fluids can be modeled in SU2 by using a data-driven method that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). This method is very efficient and accurate, but is sometimes not robust when it comes to inverse regression. The main goals of this project are:\n\nDevelop and implement a smart method for choosing the starting point of inverse regression.\nIndicate in the flow solution where predictions of the fluid properties may be unreliable (due to phase transition or inaccurate inverse regression).\nImprove the efficiency of the neural network evaluation algorithm.\nExpected Outcome (deliverables): Validation of regression algorithm robustness and validation study of algorithmic efficiency of neural network evaluation algorithm. Addition of tutorial to SU2 tutorial library and merge changes with a PR.\nSkills Required: C++, python, SU2\nPossible Mentors: Evert Bunschoten (lead)\nExpected Project Size: 175 hrs/medium\nDifficulty rating: easy-medium (experience in CFD or fluid modeling preferred)\n\n\n\n\nProject 3: Graphical User Interface: coupling to python wrapper and json validation\n\n\nProject Description (max. 5 Sentences)\nIn GSoC 2024 we improved the SU2 GUI and made it suitable for basic use. We would like to keep the momentum and focus in this project on two main things: 1. coupling with the python wrapper so users are able to write python scripts inside the GUI, and export the GUI setup in python format; and 2. Write a json validation for the configuration file. The goal is also that the json validation will replace the hardcoded c++ validation that we have in the main SU2 solver.\n\nExpected Outcome (deliverables): SU2-GUI (python+trame library), availability on github, json validation scheme, python coupling for initialization and boundary condition.\nSkills Required: Python, Paraview, SU2, Trame, json\nPossible Mentors: Nijso Beishuizen, Ujjawal Agrawal (2024 GSoC Alumnus)\nExpected Project Size: 175 hrs/medium\nDifficulty rating: medium\n\n\nProject 4: Make it easy to add and update unit tests\n\n\nProject Description (max. 5 Sentences)\nOne of the most important requirements for a CFD code is that users trust the outcome. This trust is gained by performing Unit Tests, as well as Verification and Validation tests. We need more online tests, and these tests should be 1. Easy to add and 2. Complete in their testing. We therefore need to automate the creation, adding and maintaining of these tests.\n\nExpected Outcome (deliverables) Templated and Automated unit and V&V tests, putting current tests in the new system, regeneration of the results (figures, data, etc.), possible creation of new results.\nSkills Required: python, C++\nPossible Mentors: Nijso Beishuizen (lead)\nExpected Project Size (90 hrs/ small , 175 hrs/medium, 350 hrs/large): 90hrs, small\nDifficulty rating (easy (little experience/background), medium (some experience/background), hard (experienced)): easy\n\n\n\nProject 5: Continuation of GPU acceleration in SU2\n\n\nProject Description (max. 5 Sentences)\nThe SU2 code relies heavily on sparse linear algebra. In this area, there is significant speed-up potential with the adoption of GPU-based processing, as was demonstrated in the GSOC 24 project that applied CUDA to sparse matrix-vector multiplications in SU2. The objective of this project is to move more linear algebra operations to GPU in order to avoid host-device communication bottlenecks within the sparse linear system solver.\n\nExpected Outcome (deliverables) Make SU2’s sparse linear solver GPU-native, i.e. minimal host-device communication after the initial setup of the system.\nSkills Required C++\nPossible Mentors: Pedro Gomes (lead), Ole Burghardt\nExpected Project Size (90 hrs/ small , 175 hrs/medium, 350 hrs/large): 175 hrs (medium)\nDifficulty rating (easy (little experience/background), medium (some experience/background), hard (experienced)): medium\n\nProject 6: Extending turbomachinery geometry handling for mixed-flow applications\n\n\nProject Description (max. 5 Sentences)\nMixed-flow turbomachinery components, such as NASA’s High Efficiency Centrifugal Compressor, combine the properties of both axial and radial machines. Such geometries can be difficult to simulate due to their complex geometric dependencies. This project aims to refactor SU2’s current turbomachinery geometry handling and extend it to be able to handle mixed-flow machinery.\n\nExpected Outcome (deliverables) Merged PR containing the new, flexible axes of rotation, and validation of the NASA HECC testcase\nSkills RequiredC++, SU2\nPossible Mentors: Josh Kelly\nExpected Project Size (90 hrs/ small , 175 hrs/medium, 350 hrs/large):175 hrs (medium)\nDifficulty rating (easy (little experience/background), medium (some experience/background), hard (experienced)): easy/medium\nLast edited by bigfootedrockmidget; February 10, 2025 at 16:48.\n\n  \t\n\n\n\n\nPosting Rules\n\nYou may not post new threads\nYou may not post replies\nYou may not post attachments\nYou may not edit your posts\nBB code is On\nSmilies are On\n[IMG] code is On\nHTML code is Off\nTrackbacks are Off\nPingbacks are On\nRefbacks are On\nForum Rules\n\t\n\n\nSimilar Threads\nThread\tThread Starter\tForum\tReplies\tLast Post\nGSoC Applications - How to Apply\tbigfootedrockmidget\tSU2 News & Announcements\t13\tYesterday 14:54\nMarine 2025 Conference: Invited Session (IS03) about OpenFOAM\tIHFOAM Team\tOpenFOAM Announcements from Other Sources\t0\tDecember 19, 2024 10:45\nHelp merging workbench projects\tgtarroyo\tANSYS\t1\tMay 19, 2021 06:39\nopenFoam freelancer for short projects\tsts\tCFD Freelancers\t7\tMarch 24, 2021 12:32\nSkill increasing projects for 18 months (or more)\ttohell92\tLounge\t1\tJanuary 25, 2021 01:47\n\n\n\nAll times are GMT -4.
